## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*Basalt is a very tough dark stone of volcanic origin. To mine it
effectively it's best to use a strong pickaxe. Basalt is tougher than
granite, and forms the majority of deep underground world. Occasionally
has pools of magma embedded in it, so be careful when tunnelling. Veins
of sulphur and iron might sometimes be found when you are deep enough.
Even more rarely, you will find the elusive diamond shining brightly
from between the rocks.*

## Crafting 

Basalt is only obtained by breaking the blocks. 

It is also created when water flows onto flowing magma. This allows for
the creation of an infinite basalt generator. One such design is shown
here:

### Manual Basalt Generator

<div style="overflow:hidden">

![Basalt_Gen.jpg](Basalt_Gen.jpg "Basalt_Gen.jpg")

</div>

To use this, you simply stand in front of it and break the basalt. You
stand in front of the clay, not on top of it. The basalt should hop into
your inventory and a new one will be created. This uses up no resources
except the pickaxe.

Note that there is an open block in the clay, below where the basalt
forms. This is necessary for proper operation. The whole generator may
be covered for safety and protection.

  - See the [Cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink") article for an
    automatic stone generator.

## Notes

  - Basalt may be used to make [stairs](Basalt_Stairs "wikilink"),
    [fences](Basalt_Fence "wikilink") and
    [slabs](Basalt_Slab "wikilink").
  - Basalt is one of the first non-wooden
    [paintable](Painting "wikilink") blocks, together with
    [Granite](Granite "wikilink") and [Brick
    Walls](Brick_Wall "wikilink").
