## Description

Anyone who played Minecraft probably knows about this circuit, because
it's pretty popular and also not that hard to make. The first person who
recreated this circuit in SC was
[laurensweyn](http://m.youtube.com/user/laurensweyn).

If someone doesn't know what it does - it has three inputs
([switches](Recipaedia/Electrics/Switch.md "wikilink") ) and two outputs
([lighbulbs](Recipaedia/Electrics/Lightbulb.md "wikilink") ). When you switch any switch,
lightbulb marked "1" will turn on. When you switch any two switches,
lightbulb "2" will turn on and the "1" will turn off. And finaly, when
you switch all the three switches, both lightbulbs will turn on (because
1+2=3).

Although it's easy to build (with the help of pictures), I've decided to
put a link to the world file
[here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qor069sbduvx5n1/Binary%20adder.scworld?token_hash=AAEmq4pFhbZMw3OlQ0XOcOxET0behfzD-zAtYG8x8UvFDw&dl=1).
