![Alpaca.jpg](Alpaca.jpg "Alpaca.jpg") Mods for Survivalcraft are a
highly requested feature. Here is a guide on how to mod the Android
Version of Survivalcraft. However, if you want to mod other versions of
Survivalcraft it would work analog to this tutorial.

1.  get the apk of Survivalcraft. If you have Survivalcraft installed on
    your phone you will find it under "System\>\> Apps" if your device
    is rooted. If it isn't rooted get an app backup and use the backed
    up copy.
2.  Copy the apk to your windows - pc.
3.  Rename the apk file to a .zip file.
4.  Unpack the .zip file and mod the files in it. There is a tool named
    SCPaker.Windows.exe (
    [1](http://www.mediafire.com/file/92ztz71i38xuihe/SCPaker1.3.2.zip/file)
    ) which is able to unpack the Content.pak and to repack it after
    modding. This tool is quite useful for some little mods.
    (Furthermore a tip: If you open large text files you should consider
    to open them in notepad++ or Excel / libre office calc)
5.  \---make the desired mods through the pc.
6.  In the decompiled Content folder make notepad++ to modify the
    database.xml and make models in blender .dae files and make textures
    with GIMP with a "\!" before the name (example: \!Duck.png, don't
    forget to add an alpha channel in the textures because it will not
    work\!) and replace the original files with your modded files.
7.  Recompile the content by putting the folder to SCPaker
8.  The apk-modding-app will do the work of replacing the files and
    resigning the apk.
