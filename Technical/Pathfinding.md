## Description

Pathfinding is a mechanic that makes animals able to find what they are
looking for. For example, if they see a piece of food, if they want to
attack the player, if they want to run away, etc, then they will go to
their destination, jumping over blocks as needed, and going through or
around walls and obstacles to reach what they
want.![Feature.jpg](Feature.jpg "Feature.jpg")
