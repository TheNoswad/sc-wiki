## Description

The view distance determines how far away you can see.

## Effects

The view distance directly affects the amount of processor power
required to run the game. A higher distance may cause the game to lag
and possibly crash, especially on devices with slower processors.

Beasts will only spawn within the view distance.

Electrics in general, will only work within the view distance. This can
be very important in larger electrics builds. Some electrics which keep
a value, such as the memory bank, will still keep that value when the
player is farther away.

Your kept animals will despawn if you are away from them too long. This
may also be related to the view distance, but has not been verified yet.

## Current Choices

  - 32 blocks (good for slower devices)
  - 48 blocks (good for slower devices)
  - 64 blocks
  - 80 blocks (1GB RAM recommended)
  - 96 blocks (1GB RAM recommended)
  - 112 blocks (1GB RAM recommended)
  - 128 blocks (1GB RAM recommended)
  - 160 blocks (2GB RAM and a fast device recommended)
  - 192 blocks (2GB RAM and a fast device recommended)
  - 224 blocks (2GB RAM and a fast device recommended)
  - 256 blocks (2GB RAM and a fast device recommended)
  - 288 blocks (4GB RAM and a very fast device recommended)
  - 320 blocks (4GB RAM and a very fast device recommended)
      - There is also a 1024 distance mode only available on Kaalus'
        development PC. This may also be used on desktop systems by
        [Hacking the Settings
        file](Hacking_the_Settings_file "wikilink").

## History

  - In Alpha 1.0 it only featured one setting of the visibility range:
    64 blocks. In fact there was no visibility range option.
  - In Alpha 1.15 kaalus added the visibility range option in the
    settings and the choices where: Near (32 blocks), Medium (48 blocks)
    and Far (64 blocks).
  - In 1.23 kaalus increased the maximum render distance to 2.5x of what
    was in 1.22 and the choices where: 32 blocks, 48 blocks, 64 blocks,
    96 blocks, 128 blocks and 160 blocks.
  - In 1.26 kaalus added his custom game engine which included a 256
    blocks distance.
  - In 1.27, more options were added, giving: 32 blocks, 48 blocks, 64
    blocks, 80 blocks, 96 blocks, 112 blocks, 128 blocks, 160 blocks,
    192 blocks, 224 blocks and 256 blocks.
  - In 2.1, 288 blocks and 320 blocks distance were added.

## Trivia

  - Between -2147483648 and 48 blocks, the tooltip says "(good for
    slower devices)".
  - Between 49 and 64 blocks, the tooltip says nothing.
  - Between 65 and 128 blocks, the tooltip says "(1GB RAM recommended)".
  - Between 129 and 256 blocks, the tooltip says "(2GB RAM and a fast
    device recommended)".
  - Between 257 and 512 blocks, the tooltip says "(4GB RAM and a very
    fast device recommended)".
  - Between 513 and 2147483647 blocks, the tooltip says "(8GB RAM and an
    extremely fast device recommended)".
