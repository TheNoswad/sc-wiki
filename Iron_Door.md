## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Doors are used to make entrances to buildings. They can be opened and
closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire, doors will
open and close on the rising edge of an electrical signal. Iron or cell
doors cannot be operated when electrically connected.*

## Crafting

To craft an iron door, you will need 6 [iron
ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink"). This recipe will give you 1 door.
