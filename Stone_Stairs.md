## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

Stairs make it easy to climb slopes. You no longer need to constantly
jump and climb vertical faces, instead you move faster, saving time and
energy. Stairs can be crafted from variousÂ  materials. Stairs can also
be placed upside-down on the ceilings.

## Crafting

It takes 6 [granite](Recipaedia/Terrain/Granite.md "wikilink") to craft 6 stair pieces.

## Notes

  - Stairs will automatically form corners where appropriate. To make a
    corner, one stair has to be in place. Turn to face the side of it
    and tap the *side* of that stair.
  - To place them upside-down you must have a block *above* it and tap
    that block.
  - They are useful in a variety of decoration or design features.
  - Remember stairs are NOT fluid blockers and will pop if water or
    magma touches them.
