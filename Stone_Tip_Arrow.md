## Usage

Arrows are shot from a [bow](bow "wikilink"). They are especially good
for killing animals that are hard to melee kill such as birds, or for
when severely injured animals run away so you can land the killing blow.

## Notes

  - They have a chance to break when hitting something.
  - This is usually an easy arrow to make, due to the abundance of
    gravel.
  - They may bounce back which may damage and/or kill you.
