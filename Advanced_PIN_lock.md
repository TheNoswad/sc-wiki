This circuit is an expandable PIN lock that uses the latest in
Survivalcraft technology. It is the most compact and advanced code lock
in SurvivalCraft and has many features useful to the Adventure map
maker.

Created by Stanimus using SurvivalCraft ver. 1.25

## Operation

A PIN lock requires you to input a series of numbers to unlock it. This
design displays the current number and has an UP button and a DOWN
button next to each digit. Once you have your complete number displayed,
you press the OPEN button (at the left). If the PIN is correct, the door
will open and the digits all reset to zeros. If the PIN is NOT correct,
all the digits will still reset to zeros but the door will NOT open.

Each digit in this design is a hexadecimal number so they can be from 0
through 9 and A through F (16 choices).

The pictures and download world use a 3 number PIN as the example.The
design is modular and can be used with only 1 digit or expanded to many
more (infinite?) digits.

### Programming the code

The secret code can be reprogrammed in-game and MUST be set before the
lock will work. An unprogrammed lock will NOT work even with all zeros.
To program it, you edit each of the [memory
banks](Memory_Bank "wikilink") at the back of the digit modules.

To edit the memory walk up to it and face it. The sneak button in your
HUD will turn to an EDIT button. Tap it to program the chip. The memory
chart will show up and simply tap on the FIRST line of it. This will
bring up your system's edit window. It should show you 16 zeros in a
row.

The next part is the only slightly complicated part. You want to count
from the left and change ONE of these '0's to an 'F'. If you change the
first '0', that means you want the secret number to be a '0'.Â  Look at
the top of the memory chart. That shows you the number for each column.
If you change the second column it will be a '1'. The next is '2' and so
on. The last position will mean the secret digit is a 'F'. All other
entries should be '0' except for the one you want to be the code number.

You only need to change the first line in any memory chip and you DO
have to program EACH digit to SOMETHING or the lock will NEVER open. You
can start it off at all zeros by putting an 'F' in the FIRST space on
the FIRST line of EVERY memory chip.

## Pictures

All the darker blocks are wire-through-blocks. Any of the (3)
wire-through-blocks will work. All lighter blocks can be any block that
a wire will stick to.

If the code is correct, it will open the door to its left.

The glass can be any decorative block desired. No wires need to be
attached to them.

compact. ![PIN_R_view.jpg](PIN_R_view.jpg "PIN_R_view.jpg")

There are no wires on the top or sides so this circuit can be squeezed
into an existing opening at least 3 blocks high and 10 deep. The extra
block depth is to give you room to get in to program the memories.

Each digit module has three sections to it; the counter, the memory and
the combiner sections. They will link to another module placed next to
them.

gate.

## How It Works

Each digit is a separate module and they have three sections each.

The 1st section is the counter. This uses the two
[buttons](button "wikilink"), the [digit
display](7-Segment_Display "wikilink") and a [4-bit counter
chip](4-Bit_Counter "wikilink"). The design is very straightforward. You
can see it built separately in the download world. This design has a
master reset line to zero out all the counters.

The second section is the comparator. This section is at the back of the
counter section. A [memory bank](Memory_Bank "wikilink") is used to
check the number from the counter. If it matches the one in memory, the
output is activated. The number in memory can be changed any time by
editing the memory chip. This section is simple, too. The design uses
only one input of this chip and the one output.

The last section combines the outputs of all the digit modules. It is at
the back of each digit module and uses just one [AND
gate](Logic_AND_Gate "wikilink").

In the design this output is combined with the 'open' button and that
signal is used to open the door. The 'open' signal is also fed back to
clear the counters. This keeps the 'secret code' from staying on the
display after it's checked.

### Extra features

  - The design makes it easy to tap into either output signal (with or
    without the 'open' button included) for use in another circuit.
    Actually, any stage of the AND gates can be brought out of the
    circuit. They can be tapped from the back without making the lock
    any wider or taller. These outputs are however, pulsed because the
    counters are automatically reset. This pulse can easily be turned
    into a constant signal with more electrics if you wish.

<!-- end list -->

  - Some application may not want to have the counters reset and it is
    very simple to disable this function.
  - The reset input line can be tapped into in order to disable the
    entire lock operation, including the counters and displays.
  - For even more complex Adventures, the 'open' button signal can be
    brought out for options such as limiting the number of attempts the
    player is allowed.
  - There is also an option to have another signal ANDed into the
    combiner section. This can prevent the lock from opening but the
    display will continue to operate as 'normal'.
  - Any of these signals can be used to activate a sign that can inform
    the player of the situation whether it's a successful unlock, a 'try
    again', or a failed 'assignment' that needs to be complete before
    they can open the lock. These are just some examples.
  - The memories can be programmed in more creative fashion as well. You
    can allow for 2 or more 'correct answers'. You could even let one
    digit (or all of them) be ANY number. To do this, program the memory
    with ALL 16 'F's in the first row.

## Link

The ver. 2.0 compact lock can be downloaded
[HERE](https://app.box.com/s/0k273b35j21nooeb3uau). This world has the
'finished' lock as well as one 'complete' digit module. It also shows
the steps to construct each module. This should make it easier to see
how to build it and easier to understand how it works. The secret code
in the upload is already displayed on the lock.
