    category. They can be thrown or dropped and gathered afterwards.

## Uses

If you gather enough experience orbs, your
[character](Character "wikilink") will advance to the next level.
Levelling up your character increases some of your statistics like melee
power, accuracy, resilience, movement speed, food depletion etc and
allows to the player to use [diamond](Recipaedia/Minerals/Diamond.md "wikilink") tools,
weapons, and armor.
