__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description

Challenging is the normal survival mode. There is danger, but you will
be able to respawn at your last sleep position when you die. If you
haven't slept yet, you will spawn at the original drop-off point. It is
the second hardest gamemode.

## Gameplay Features

  - Finite supply of
    [blocks](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Blocks),
    [items](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Items),
    etc. They must be gathered from the environment or crafted.
  - Character can be hurt or killed by catching fire or freezing. See
    the [Health and Damage System](Health_and_Damage_System "wikilink")
    page.
  - [Animals](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Animals)
    are provoked more easily than in [Harmless
    mode](Harmless_Gamemode "wikilink"). Simply touching a hostile
    animal will cause them to attack you.
  - Animals cannot be easily set afire with [Matches](Match "wikilink").
  - Sleep is necessary every 2 days. Without it, you may faint - usually
    when in a dangerous situation.
  - [Tools](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Tools) and
    [Weapons](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Weapons)
    wear down and eventually break.
  - No animal [spawn
    eggs](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs) \[aside
    from birds\] are avaliable.
  - Eating is necessary for survival. See for more info.

## Notes

  - See [World Options](World_Options "wikilink") to learn how to change
    the game mode.

<!-- end list -->

  - You are unable to edit terrain generation , enviroment behavior,
    etc. while it is set to Challenging Mode. You can still get around
    this by creating the desired world in [Creative
    Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") and changing it into
    challenging mode AFTER the world has been generated.
      - Berore 2.0, it wasn't possible to change temperature and
        humidity in non-creative modes.
