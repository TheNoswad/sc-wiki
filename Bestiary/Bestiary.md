## Using the Bestiary

The Bestiary is used to find information about entities such as a
[Character](Character "wikilink"), [Duck](Duck "wikilink"),
[Wildboar](Wildboar "wikilink") and etc. It even describes the rare
entities, such as the [White Bull](White_Bull "wikilink"), [White
Tiger](White_Tiger "wikilink"), [Beluga Whale](Beluga_Whale "wikilink")
and [Orca](Orca "wikilink"), whose [Creative
Eggs](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") are hidden in the Creative game mode. It
includes information such as the damage resilience, attack power, speed,
jump height or weight of a specific entity or creature. It will also
tell you if a [Creative Egg](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") is available for
an entity, if they have herding behavior, and if they may be ridden.

shows a typical description screen. There is another pair of darts at
the top. These will scroll through all creatures listed under this
category. The main part of the screen shows the description for the
chosen object. If it's a long description, you can swipe the text up to
show more. The bottom shows a list of important values for this
creature. This can be swiped if it's a long list, too.

After you are finished looking through the information, tap the top-left
dart to back-up out of the bestiary.
