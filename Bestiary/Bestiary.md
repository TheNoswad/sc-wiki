## Using the Bestiary

The Bestiary is used to find information about entities such as a [Character](Character "wikilink"), [Duck](Duck "wikilink"), [Wildboar](Wildboar "wikilink") and etc. It even describes the rare entities, such as the [White Bull](White_Bull "wikilink"), [White Tiger](White_Tiger "wikilink"), [Beluga Whale](Beluga_Whale "wikilink") and [Orca](Orca "wikilink"), whose [Creative Eggs](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") are hidden in the Creative game mode. It includes information such as the damage resilience, attack power, speed, jump height or weight of a specific entity or creature. It will also tell you if a [Creative Egg](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") is available for an entity, if they have herding behavior, and if they may be ridden.

This picture shows a typical description screen. There is another pair of darts at the top. These will scroll through all creatures listed under this category. The main part of the screen shows the description for the chosen object. If it's a long description, you can swipe the text up to show more. The bottom shows a list of important values for this creature. This can be swiped if it's a long list, too.
