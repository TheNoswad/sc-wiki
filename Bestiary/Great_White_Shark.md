## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A huge, aggressive ocean shark. Will chase anything that comes close
in the water. Has very good smell and will home on its prey from far
away. Extremely strong, will kill all land animals easily. Only
[wha](Orca "wikilink")[les](Beluga_Whale "wikilink") can withstand its
ferocious attack*."

## Description

The great white sharks prowl the deep ocean looking for fresh meat. They
are much bigger and stronger than any kind of shark, being second only
to the killer whale. This shark is extremely dangerous for the player,
since it can kill it in a few seconds, it is advisable to avoid it if
you do not have heavy weapons such as the musket.

Both sharks are carnivores, meaning they will eat
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\].

Sharks are hostile, and will attack you on sight. They drop between 8 to
10 raw fish when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Great white shark appears in oceans.

## Notes

Great White Shark can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") using a [Spawner
Egg.](Creative_Eggs "wikilink")
