__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large animal that can be ridden if equipped with a saddle. Once
saddled, will respond to whistle. Fast moving, temperamental and mildly
aggressive. Lives in deserts."*

## Description

Camels are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Purple
flowers](Purple_Flower "wikilink"), [red
flowers](Red_Flower "wikilink"), [white
flowers](White_Flower "wikilink"), [tall grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink"),
andÂ [ivy](Ivy "wikilink").

Camels are non-hostile\*\* mountable animals, and drop 4
[leather](Leather "wikilink") and 1 [raw meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink") when
killed (if previously saddled, they will also drop their
[saddle](saddle "wikilink")).

Camels can also jump single fences, so a completely enclosed structure
or double fences are needed.

## Appearance Biome

Camels spawn in deserts.

## Uses

Camels are mountable animals, so they are useful to get from one place
to another more quickly than on foot. But sometimes, camels are passive
to the player, but if hit, they will start attacking the player.

Camel can be spawned in [creative
gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") using a [spawner
egg](Creative_Eggs "wikilink").

\*\*This animal is GENERALLY passive, but there is a chance it will
retaliate when injured.
