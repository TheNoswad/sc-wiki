## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large, dangerous mammal omnivore. Will chase anything that
approaches it. Faster, larger and more powerful than other bears. Lives
only in very cold areas. Not edible, but provides fur when hunted."*

## Description

Bears are mammals in Survivalcraft and spawn in 3 varieties: Brown,
Black, and Polar.Â Polar bears are completely white.

All three bears are omnivores, meaning they will eat meat and plants.
Bears will eat:
[Bacon](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bacon) \[raw or
cooked\], [Bird](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bird) \[raw
or cooked\], [Fish](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_fish)
\[raw or cooked\],
[pumpkins](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Pumpkin), and
[bread](bread "wikilink").

Bears are hostile, meaning they will attack you on sight. If you kill
the bears, however, the reward is great. They drop
[Furwhen](Fur "wikilink") killed.

## Appearance Biome

Polar Bears spawn in snowy habitats/icy shores.

## Uses

Bears drop [Fur](Fur "wikilink"), which is used to craft heavy clothing.
