## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A medium-sized cat. Powerful, fast and able to jump very high. It is
almost impossible to run away from it once it starts the chase. Smaller
than [Jaguar](Jaguar "wikilink") or [Tiger](Tiger "wikilink")*."

## Description

The leopard is a big cat with yellow fur and dark spots and is medium
size. It is a carnivorous and relatively dangerous animal, although to a
lesser extent compared to other cats, it is also a shy animal, during
the day it will flee from the player. It has the ability to jump high.

Leopards are carnivores, meaning they will eat:
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\].

Leopards are extremely hostile, and will attack you on sight. When
dying, they drop a piece of [rotten meat](Rotten_Meat "wikilink") with
50% chance and a piece of [leather](leather "wikilink").

## Appearance Biome

Leopards appear in Jungle/Forests.

## Uses

Leopard can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") using a [Spawner
Egg.](Creative_Eggs "wikilink")
