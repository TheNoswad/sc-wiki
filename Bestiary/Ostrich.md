__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large flightless bird. Not aggressive, but runs very fast. Sometimes
lays large, edible eggs."*

## Description

The Ostrich is a large bird in Survivalcraft. They are flightless, and
have white, black, and tan feathers.

Ostriches are herbivores, but they will only eat fruit. So you can feed
them [Pumpkins](Pumpkin "wikilink").

If you follow them from a distance, they will drop eggs which are very
nutritious when cooked. One cooked Ostrich [egg](egg "wikilink") will
restore 2 hearts.

They are non hostile, and drop 1 [Raw Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") and 3-6
[Feathers](Feather "wikilink") when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Ostriches are found in deserts.

## Uses

Ostriches are extremely useful animals in the game. They lay very
nutritious eggs, Raw bird, and many feathers which can be used to craft
[arrows](Diamond_Tip_Arrow "wikilink"). And because they can be herded
with a [whistle](whistle "wikilink"), you can keep them in a fence to
harvest eggs.

Ostrich can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)
