__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A very large cat. Extremely powerful, fast and able to jump very high.
It is almost impossible to run away from it once it starts the chase.
Larger and stronger than any other cat, only very large and armored
animals like Rhinoceros can survive its attack."*

## Description

White tigers are large cats in Survivalcraft. They are normally orange
with black stripes, however, the rare white tiger is white with black
stripes.

Both tigers are carnivores, meaning they will eat:
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\].

Tigers are extremely hostile, and will attack you on sight. They drop
nothing when killed.

## Appearance Biome

White Tigers are found exclusively in cold, snowy habitats, usually far
from icy shores.

## Uses

Because White Tigers are extremely hostile and drop nothing when killed,
they do you more harm than good.

## Notes

Because these tigers are rare, they have no [spawn
egg](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") in [Creative
Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"). White Tiger Spawner is encoded
as 6291574. Therefore, you can replace the egg in hand with this value
by [editing the Project file](Hacking_The_Project_File "wikilink").
