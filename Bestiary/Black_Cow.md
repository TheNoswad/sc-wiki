## Description (From [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large grass-eating mammal. Can be milked with a bucket. Milk is
regenerated after some time, faster than by a brown cow. Docile, but
sometimes decides to stand its ground when attacked. Often protected by
nearby bulls. Delicious to eat."*

## Description

The Black Cow is a mammal in Survivalcraft with a white and black
spotted pelt.

Cows are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Purple

Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/White_Flower), [Tall
Grass](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Tall_Grass),
andÂ [Ivy](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Ivy).

They are non hostile\*\*, but their guardian bulls will attack you if
you get too close to his herd, attack the cows, or milk the cows. They
drop 1-3 [Raw Bacon](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bacon)
