__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large flightless bird. Quite aggressive and has very sharp claws
that may inflict catastrophic injuries to an unwary attacker. Sometimes
lays large, edible eggs."*

## Description

The Cassowary is a large bird in Survivalcraft. It is flightless and has
gray, blue, and pink coloration.

If you follow them from a distance, they will drop eggs which are very
nutritious when cooked.

They eat [Pumpkins](Pumpkin "wikilink").

They are semi-hostile, have a very powerful attack, and drop 2 [Raw
Bird](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bird) and 4-6
[Feathers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Feather) when killed.

They can easily outrun the character and almost always will fight back
when attacked and also protect each other but, a cassowary spawned from
a laid cassowary egg will not be protected by the cassowary that laid
the egg. Because of its speed and hostility, you must be cautious around
it. Ranged attacks recommended.

## Appearance Biome

Cassowaries are found in Desert and Lush Forest
[Biomes](Biomes "wikilink").

## Uses

Cassowaries can be used for eggs, which can be eaten either raw or
cooked.Â See [Egg Farms](Egg_Farms "wikilink") for more details.

Cassowaries can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)
