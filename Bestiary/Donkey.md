__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A stubborn animal that can be ridden if equipped with a saddle. Once
saddled, will respond to whistle. Fast moving, not aggressive and very
resilient to falls. Sometimes has a fit of stubbornness and refuses to
move. Feeding it will often resolve the problem."*

## Description

The Donkey is a mammal in Survivalcraft similar to the
[Horse](Horse "wikilink") . It has a tan colored coat, white muzzle, and
large ears.

Donkeys are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Red
Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Flower), [Purple
Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Purple_Flower), [White
Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/White_Flower), [Tall
Grass](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Tall_Grass),
and [Ivy](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Ivy).

They are non-hostile\*\*, and drop nothing when killed unless saddled
\[in which case they drop their saddle\].

## Appearance Biome

Donkeys are found mostly in Deserts and occasionally in Jungles.

## Uses

Donkeys can be used to get from one place to another very quickly, as
they are mountable. They save you a lot of time when traveling, herding
cattle, etc. They also have a greater fall resilience than horses and
camels.

Donkey can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)

## Notes

Donkeys are generally stubborn and do not like to be ridden. You must
feed them well or they will not behave. 

\*\*This animal is GENERALLY passive, but there is a chance it will
retaliate when injured.
