## Description (from [Bestiary]( "wikilink"))

*"A docile animal that can be ridden if equipped with a saddle. Once
saddled, will respond to whistle. Very fast moving and not aggressive."*

## Description

The Horse is a mammal in Survivalcraft with a variety of appearances.
There are 5 different coat colors, as shown below.

Horses are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Red

Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Purple_Flower), [White
Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/White_Flower), [Tall

## Appearance Biome

Horses are usually found in Jungles/Forests/Plains

## Uses

Horses can be used to get from one place to another very quickly, as
they are mountable. They save you a lot of time when traveling, herding
cattle, etc.

Horses can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)

They are non-hostile, and drop nothing when killed unless saddled \[in
which case they drop their [Saddle](Saddle "wikilink").

## Notes

  - All mountable animals can get 'stubborn' and refuse to move. They
    may even shake their head 'no'. Feeding them will usually get them
    calm again. You can feed the horse while mounted by dropping some
    feed from your hotbar or inventory. Palomino horses are the least
    stubborn and the black horse is the most stubborn. 

<!-- end list -->

  - The only way to contain horses is with a corral or stable. There is
    no rein, lasso or leash in the game. 

<!-- end list -->

  - When in [Challenging Gamemode](Challenging_Gamemode "wikilink"),
    [Harmless Gamemode](Harmless_Gamemode "wikilink"), [Cruel
    Gamemode](Cruel_Gamemode "wikilink") or [Adventure
    Gamemode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink"), if your horse jumps up and
    there are blocks above you, it will instantly suffocate you. In
    [Creative Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"), this will simply
    dismount you. There must be 3 blocks clearance to ride through and 4
    blocks in case the horse jumps.

<!-- end list -->

  - Palomino Horses tend to be the least stubborn, while the black is
    the most stubborn.

  - Wearing [Cavalry Boots](Cavalry_Boots "wikilink") whilst riding will
    make your horse go faster.
