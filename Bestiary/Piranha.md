__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A small predatory fish that is extremely aggressive and hunts in
packs. A pack of hungry piranhas will make a short work of almost any
creature that steps in the water. Not edible. Lives in warm areas
only."*

## Description

Piranhas are very hostile fish lurking in Survivalcraft lakes. They are
monochromatic blue in color, and have sharp teeth.

They are carnivores, meaning they will eat:
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\].

Piranhas are extremely hostile, and should be avoided at all costs. They
will attack you in large numbers as soon as you step foot in their
water. They drop nothing when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Piranhas spawn in Jungle lakes, pools, and rivers. They may also be
found in other waters, as long as the water is deep and wide enough. 

## Uses

Piranhas are extremely hostile and drop nothing when killed, so they do
you more harm than good.

Piranha can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)

## Notes

Piranhas will attack a boat if you are riding it and quickly destroy the
boat, then eat you. However, if you dismount the boat and just stand on
it, they will go away since they cannot reach you any longer. You may be
able to attack them while standing on the boat but you risk damaging the
boat.
