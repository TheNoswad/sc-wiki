__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A very large predatory mammal that lives in deep ocean. Extremely
strong and dangerous, will chase anything that moves. Provides plenty of
food when hunted."*

## Description

The Orca Whale is a mammal in Survivalcraft and the largest animal in
the game thus far. It has black and white coloration.

Orcas are carnivores, meaning they will eat:
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\].

Orcas are extremely hostile and drop 6-8 [Raw
Fish](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_fish) when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Orcas are rare and only spawn far out in the ocean. They always stay
near the surface, however, so you won't find them too deep.

## Uses

Orcas are extremely hostile and almost impossible to kill, If you manage
it, the reward is great though: 6-8 Raw Fish.

## Notes

The Orca is rare, so it has no [Spawner Egg](Creative_Eggs "wikilink")
in [Creative Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"). Orca Spawner is
encoded as 12058742. Therefore, you can replace the egg in hand with
this value by [editing the Project
file](Hacking_The_Project_File "wikilink").
