__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large cat. Powerful and fast, likes to hunt at night. Larger then
[leopard](leopard "wikilink") or [jaguar](jaguar "wikilink"), but not as
dangerous as [tiger](tiger "wikilink")."*

## Description

The lion is a large cat in Survivalcraft with golden fur and a sepia
mane.

The lion is a carnivore, meaning it will eat
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink"), [Bird](Raw_Bacon "wikilink"), and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink")\[raw, cooked or rotten\].

Lions are extremely hostile, especially at night. Once the sun goes
down, this predator will come looking for you. They drop nothing when
killed.

## Appearance Biome

Lions appear in deserts and forests, but because they come looking for
you at night, they can be found in different areas as well.

## Uses

Lions drop nothing when killed and are extremely hostile, so they do you
more harm than good.

Lion can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)
