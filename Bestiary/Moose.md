## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large grass-eating mammal with formidable horns. Not normally
aggressive, but will often defend itself when attacked. Strong and
resilient, it often manages to scare away packs of small predators.
Lives in cold areas. Delicious to eat and provides valuable fur when
hunted."*
