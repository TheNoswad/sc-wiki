## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large, dangerous mammal omnivore. Will chase anything that
approaches it. Fairly slow, but powerful. Unlike black bear, likes warm
areas. Not edible, but provides fur when hunted."*

## Description

Bears are mammals in Survivalcraft and spawn in 3 varieties: Brown,
[Black Bear](Black_Bear "wikilink"), and [Polar](Polar_Bear "wikilink").
Brown Bears have a brown coat, creme colored muzzles, and amber eyes.

All three bears are omnivores, meaning they will eat meat and plants.
Bears will eat: [Bacon](Raw_Meat "wikilink")
([raw ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bacon)or [cooked](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Cooked_Bacon)),
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink")
([raw ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bird)or [cooked](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Cooked_Bird)),
[Fish](Raw_Fish "wikilink")
([raw ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Fish)or
[cooked](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Cooked_Fish)),
[pumpkins](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Pumpkin), and
[bread](bread "wikilink").

Bears are hostile, meaning they will attack you on sight. If you kill
the bears, however, the reward is great. They drop [Fur](Fur "wikilink")
and [Rotten Meat](Rotten_Meat "wikilink") when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Brown Bears spawn in Jungles/Forests.

## Uses

Bears will drop [Fur](Fur "wikilink") when killed, so they may be used
to craft Heavy Clothing.

Brown Bear can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)
