## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large grass-eating mammal. Not normally aggressive but does not like
anyone who approaches too close. Very protective towards the cows.
Dangerous when enraged. Delicious to eat."*

Flowers](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/White_Flower), [Tall
Grass](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Tall_Grass),
and [Ivy](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Ivy).

They are docile but will charge at you and chase you for long distances
if you strike them or if you attack or milk one of their cows. They drop
