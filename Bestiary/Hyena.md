__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

"*A small, aggressive and unpleasant predatory mammal. Hunts at night in
packs. During the day is shy and prefers to stay away from trouble. Very
dangerous in large numbers.*"

## Habitat

Hyenas can be found in Survivalcraft in arid deserts, hot forests, and
in the abysmal depths of caves.

## Appearance and Behavior

Hyenas sport black muzzles, black ears, brown spotted coats, a thin
tail, and a downward sloping back.

They're also pack animals that will not only hunt their prey in large
groups, but will also defend each other when attacked. During the
daytime, hyenas will run from the player when approached. However, note
that in the Challenging, Hardcore, and Adventure game modes they will
not shy away from attacking the Player despite initial actions to flee.

At night, hyenas will track down and converge upon the player's
location. And if out in the open, the player will be attacked by the
predators and upon being killed, the death message "Eaten by a hyena"
will appear. Hyenas will also eat raw, cooked, and rotten meat of all
kinds of meat such as bacon, fish, and bird. They do not eat eggs.

## Uses

Hyenas have a 50% chance of dropping [Rotten
Meat](Rotten_Meat "wikilink") and will drop Leather upon being killed
which can be used to craft [clothing](Clothing "wikilink") and a
[saddle](saddle "wikilink").

Hyena can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)
