## Usage

Arrows are shot from a [bow](bow "wikilink"). They are especially good
for killing animals that are hard to melee kill such as birds, or for
when severely injured animals run away so you can land the killing blow.

Iron arrows are used to make [diamond tipped
arrows](Diamond_Tip_Arrow "wikilink").

## Notes

  - They have a chance to break when hitting something.
  - All projectile ammo has a high chance of breaking glass if it hits
    it.
  - All projectiles have a chance at rebounding back at the player and
    can do significant damage and/or result in death.
