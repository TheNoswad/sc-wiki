## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Snowballs are made by compacting snow in one's hands. Soft and light,
they can be thrown without risk of inflicting damage to the surroundings
or injuries in the bystanders. Perfect for fun fights. Be careful when
throwing them at dangerous animals, they will usually take a dim view of
that.*

## Uses for snowballs

Snowballs are [Throwable items](Throwable_items "wikilink"). They can be
thrown at animals inflicting very minimal damage. If you wish to put out
a campfire, simply tap on the fire with a snowball in hand.

## Where Can I Find Snowballs?

To find snowballs, you must first find [Snow](Snow "wikilink"). Snow can
be found in cold and icy biomes. Uppon finding snow, break it, and you
will receive 2-3 snowballs.

## Notes

  - Snowballs were added in 1.7 along with trap equipments.
  - Snowballs disappear when thrown randomly.
  - Snowballs can still break weak blocks, and can be thrown to deal
    some damage.
  - In 1.28 the Snowball has a new 3D model instead of 2D
