__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A bucket full of paint. Can be used to paint surfaces for decorative
purposes. Different colors of paint are obtained by dissolving colored
ingredients, such as malachite or purple flowers into white paint.*

## Crafting

White paint buckets are made by cooking [white
pigment](White_Pigment "wikilink") with a [water
bucket](water_Bucket "wikilink") in a [furnace](furnace "wikilink"). All
other colors begin with the white paint bucket and add other ingredients
the same way.

Many colors will require several steps to get the proper color. See
Recipedia or the [painting](painting "wikilink") page for the recipes
for each color.
