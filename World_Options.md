When creating a new world or modifying one, you have access to a menu
with some options.

On this page we will explain what they are and what they do.

### Main Options

  - World name: This is where you have the option to name your world. If
    you do not want a custom name, a random one will be chosen. See [New
    World Names](New_World_Names "wikilink") page for default world
    names. The world name can be modified later. 
  - Seed: This is an alphanumerical character chain that is used by the
    world generation algorithm to generate terrain. Two worlds with the
    same seed will be generated identitally. Leave blank for a random
    seed. You cannot change this setting later. 
  - Starting Position: Here you can choose where the ship lefts the
    player. There are three: Easy, Medium and Hard
  - Game mode: Here you can choose the game mode. It can be changed
    anytime, except for Cruel gamemode (you can only chose Cruel at
    creation of the world, and it can't be modified afterwards). The
    possible gamemodes are [Challenging
    Gamemode](Challenging_Gamemode "wikilink"), [Cruel
    Gamemode](Cruel_Gamemode "wikilink"), [Creative
    Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"), [Harmless
    Gamemode](Harmless_Gamemode "wikilink") , and [Adventure
    Gamemode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink"). Adventure Gamemode cannot
    be chosen at world creation. A previously created world may be
    changed to adventure mode to create a quest or adventure type world.
  - There is a button on the bottom of the screen that says **Setup
    Player** that sends you to the [Player
    Options](Player_Options "wikilink") screen.

### Creative Options

If you have chosen Creative as a gamemode, you can change many world
options.

  - Customize Paint Colors: It has a selection of all the 16 colors
    available in the game. You can change every color on the game by
    adjusting the RGB. Also you can rename it.
  - Supernatural creatures: In **ENABLED** hostile creatures or
    semi-hostile creatures will spawn in the world. In **DISABLED** no
    hostile or semi-hostile creatures will summon.
  - Player-on-player attacks: In **ENABLED** you can attack other
    players. In **DISABLED** you cannot attack other players.
  - Environment behavior: In **LIVING** mode the world is a living place
    full of animals. Plants and grass grow, blocks made of loose
    material collapse and detached leaves decay. In **STATIC** mode the
    world has no animals. Plants growth, block collapsing and plant
    decay are disabled. Useful if you want to shape your world the way
    you want it.
  - Time of Day: Choose whether you want time to flow normally or if you
    want the stars, sun and moon to stay stationary at a particular
    moment of time (**DAY**, **NIGHT**, **SUNRISE**, or **SUNSET**. If
    you are building large, it can be useful to set the time to sunrise
    so you always know which way the ocean is.
  - Weather effects: **ENABLED** (The world will experience periodical
    occurences of rain and snow that will accumulate on the ground.
    Lightning will strike tall objects and set them on fire.) or
    **DISABLED** (There will be no precipitation or lightning in the
    world.)
  - Adventure Respawn: **ALLOWED** (The player will be able to respawn
    at his last spawn or sleeping place when he dies (good for long
    adventures with checkpoints)) or **NOT ALLOWED** (The player will
    not be able to respawn, but will have to restart the adventure and
    start from scratch when he dies (good for small adventures with no
    checkpoints))
  - Adventure survival mechanics, if enabled will make your character
    stay at a constant hunger, stamina and will not be affected by sleep
    loss. When disabled, adventure mode you will need to eat, sleep and
    stop and catch your breath when moving.

        This is used when creating a world that will later be saved in
        ADVENTURE mode.

<!-- end list -->

  - Terrain Mode: In **Continent** mode the environment is made to look
    like the real world, full of forests, plains, deserts, glaciers,
    lakes. mountains, hills, caves and so on. In **Flat Continent** mode
    the terrain is completely flat, giving you the total freedom of
    creation. You can also change terrain level, shore roughness and
    type of block that fills it. In **Island** mode the enviroment is an
    island generated with water around it. You can change the size of
    the island. In **Flat Island** mode is an island generated with
    water around it and is completely flat, giving you the total freedom
    of creation. You can also change the size of the island, terrain
    level, shore roughness and type of block that fills it.

<!-- end list -->

  - Sea level, it is only increasable and at the highest amount the
    world will be made up of small islands.
  - You can change the global temperature and humidity of the world in
    either flat or normal terrain modes.  They range from -16 to +16 and
    will determine the average world values.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        In continent mode, the temperature and humidity will still vary
        according to the local biome. A lower value of temp will create
        mostly cold biomes covered in snow or ice. A higher temp will
        create warmer biomes with little or no snow. A higher humidity
        will create more wet areas and jungle or marsh type biomes. A
        lower humidity will create more desert and wasteland biomes with
        very little vegetation. The temp and humidity can be adjusted to
        create the type of world environment you wish.

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        In flat continent mode, the temperature and humidity will be the
        same everywhere. For instance, a temp value of -10 or less will
        have thermometer readings of '0' everywhere in the world

        Flat continent mode options:

<!-- end list -->

  - Flat Terrain Level: Adjust the level of terrain above bedrock, only
    applicable in flat terrain mode. The lower you put it, the more
    space will be available above ground. The higher you put it, the
    more space will be available underground. (At the maximum of 104,
    you will have 22 blocks above the ground level in which to build.)
  - Flat terrain block: You can choose which type of block you want the
    world to be made of. The choices are: Grass, Dirt, Sand, Granite,
    Basalt, Limestone, Sandstone, Cobblestone, Stone Bricks, Brick Wall,
    Solid Iron Block, Solid Copper Block, Glass, Ice, Marble, Solid
    Diamond Block, Malachite Block or Bedrock. (Yes, you can have a
    world made of solid diamond blocks\!) The bedrock bottom of the
    world will always still be bedrock.
  - Magma Ocean: Turn the ocean into a sea of magma. This is usually not
    a good idea.![Magmaocean2.jpg](Magmaocean2.jpg "Magmaocean2.jpg")
  - Flat terrain shore roughness: When roughness is higher, the shore
    looks similar to the Continent mode, but, when you put 0%, it makes
    the classic straight shore.

<!-- end list -->

  - Although Solid Diamond Block is flammable, you can choose that as
    your terrain block with a magma ocean. However it does not seem to
    catch fire. It does not seem to make an ice world melt, either.
  - If you set a living environment, birds will land on it and catch
    fire plus, there will be no fish of course.
  - The magma ocean option was added in 1.23.
