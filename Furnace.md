## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A furnace is an enclosure made from fire resistant stone, in which a
high temperature is maintained by burning combustible fuel. It is an
important item that allows smelting, cooking and other forms of heat
processing. The best fuel for the furnace are coal chunks, but wood and
even leaves can be used if coal is unavailable. Furnace can be left
unattended while working. It also emits a small amount of light.*

## Uses

The furnace is extremely useful for basic survival. It is used mainly to
cook food, like [bread](bread "wikilink"), [raw
bacon](Recipaedia/Food/Raw_Bacon.md "wikilink"), [raw fish](raw_fish "wikilink"), [raw
bird](Recipaedia/Food/Raw_Bird.md "wikilink"), and [eggs](eggs "wikilink"), and to smelt
ores. See the [smelting](smelting "wikilink") page for more details.

## Crafting

To craft a furnace, place 8 [granite](granite "wikilink") or
[cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink") blocks around the crafting table,
leaving a empty slot in the middle. You will get one furnace.

## Notes

  - Coal Blocks have a fuel value of 600, while coal chunks have a fuel
    value of 80. It takes 9 chunks to make a block, so 9 chunks will
    give a fuel value of 720, versus 600 for the block, wasting 120 fuel
    values. So, it is more efficient to use COAL CHUNKS -NOT- COAL
    BLOCKS \!\!\!
  - Go to [Smelting](Smelting "wikilink") to see what items can be
    smelted.

<!-- end list -->

  - If you put an explosive, like a gunpowder keg in the fuel slot and
    put something to smelt or cook, the furnace will explode.
