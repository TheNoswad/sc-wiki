This page is for discussions about issues with the COMMUNITY CONTENT -
ONLY\!

It is NOT a general purpose "wants" page. To add wanted features, the
best place is on the official forum at: [WANTED
FEATURES](http://survivalcraft.lefora.com/forums/1377297/Feature-Requests).

## Wanted features

1: The community content needs a search bar, so you can get the maps you
want easier.

2: There should be an easier blocking feature to the community content.
This feature stops people from making worlds because they're offensive
or inappropriate. There is already a feature like that, but more like a
2 week ban.

3: You should be able ro report or rate content without downloading it
first.

4: When a download fails, the author should be notified of it.

5: You should be able to sign in with another account, such as box.com
or google (if you are not concerned about privacy); instead of a dropbox
, to make things a lot easier.

## Problems

In the past people seemed to make a lot of inappropriate worlds, and
they still do. They usually have very few downloads and will eventually
be removed if they are reported enough.

Many of these worlds are used by 'clans' as nothing more than a
messaging system. These people may not even actually play the game.
