## Notes

  - Wooden Leggings, along with the [Wooden Chest
    Plate](Wooden_Chest_Plate "wikilink") are good pieces of armor to
    craft at the beginning of the game.
  - Be careful that an orca can destroy the wooden leggings in one hit.
  - Wooden Leggings are not durable enough to protect you from musket
    balls.
