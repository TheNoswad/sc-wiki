## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Old hat you wore when being abandoned on this land. Can be Dyed. No
Protection. Weak Insulation.*

## Notes

Cannot be crafted. This is the hat you start the game with. If you die
and respawn, the hat will be gone and you will be left with just the
shorts on the default skin, unless of course, you manage to find your
hat in time.
