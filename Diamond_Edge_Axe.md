__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Axes are tools for cutting soft blocks, such as wood, furniture or
leaves. They greatly speed up the cutting process, but eventually they
will get damaged and fail. Axes made of better materials will last
longer and cut faster. Axe is also a powerful weapon, although it is
very difficult to hit a moving target.*

## Crafting

Crafting requires 3 [diamonds](Diamond "wikilink") and an [Iron
Axe](Iron_Axe "wikilink"). You get 1 axe.

## Notes

  - The axe does not have to be newly made to be coated with diamond.
    You can coat a worn item and it will be as good as new.
