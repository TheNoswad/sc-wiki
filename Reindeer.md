## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A medium size plant eating mammal. Docile despite a pair of formidable
antlers. Lives in herds in cold areas. Delicious to eat."*

## Description

Reindeers are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Red
Flowers](Recipaedia/Plants/Red_Flower.md "wikilink"), [Purple
Flowers](Recipaedia/Plants/Purple_Flower.md "wikilink"), [White
Flowers](Recipaedia/Plants/White_Flower.md "wikilink"), [Tall Grass](Recipaedia/Plants/Tall_Grass.md "wikilink"),
[Ivy](Recipaedia/Plants/Ivy.md "wikilink"), and [Pumpkins](Recipaedia/Plants/Pumpkin.md "wikilink").

They are non-hostile\*\*, and drop [Raw Meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink") when
killed.

## Appearance Biome

Reindeers are found in cold, snowy habitats.

## Uses

Because Reindeer are very easy to kill, are non-hostile, and drop bacon,
they are an easy food source.

Reindeer can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)

\*\*This animal is GENERALLY passive, but there is a chance it will
retaliate when injured.
