## Description

Smoke is an Entity added in 1.25. It is very similar to debris. It is a
different entity despite an identical appearance. It is caused by
burning objects. __NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__ Picture 1: Debris,
usually caused by exploding [Gunpowder Kegs](../Recipaedia/Items/Gunpowder_Kegs.md "wikilink"),
can have a smoke trail until they land.

Picture 2: Smoke is also caused when flaming objects disintegrate. A
block of [Oak Leaves](../Recipaedia/Plants/Oak_Leaves.md "wikilink") are used in this example.
