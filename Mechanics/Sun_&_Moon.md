The sun and moon rise and set in Survivalcraft, and the moon changes
phases nightly. They will often be obscured by cloud cover, however. In
creative mode, you can set the time of day or night, and they will not
move across the sky.

## Sun

The sun will rise at dawn and set at dusk. It emits a vivid orange and
pink coloration in the morning and evening. Once it reaches noon, the
sun is at its zenith - its highest point in the sky, and the day is half
over.

## Moon

The moon rises as the sun sets and vice-versa. It goes through 8 phases.

</div>

Each phase takes one Survivalcraft day. So the SC month is only 8 days
long. When the moon is at its zenith the night is half over.

## Notes

The day/night cycle in Survivalcraft worlds is 20 minutes long (real
time).

The sun and moon are in lockstep and never pass each other in the sky.
This actually makes the moon phases nonsensical. But the changing phases
do give the appearance of Earth-like nightly variation.

During the new moon (only the outline of moon is visible) or full moon
(all of moon is visible) wolves near the player may transform into
werewolves during the night.

New Moons give off less light than regular moons and the full moon is
brighter.
