## Description

Dropped items are the miniature 'floating' blocks that you can pick up
(if you have room in your inventory). They can be created in several
ways. Simply dropping an item from inventory is one way. Animals cannot
pick up dropped items but they can eat some.

## What items can be dropped?

Any
[item](:Category:Items "wikilink") / [block](:Category:Blocks "wikilink")
in your inventory can be dropped and picked back up.

## Dropped Item Sources

Any time you break a block with the proper tool or better, the block
'drops' so you can pick it up. Regular terrain will usually drop a copy
of itself. Ore blocks usually drop 1 or more of their ores or crystals.
Breaking granite will drop cobblestone while breaking gravel may drop a
gravel block and/or [stone chunk](../Recipaedia/Terrain/Stone_Chunk.md "wikilink"). Some blocks
such as glass, will drop nothing.

Animals can also drop items. When an animal is killed, it may drop meat,
[fur](fur "wikilink"), [leather](leather "wikilink"), a
[saddle](saddle "wikilink"), or [feathers](../Recipaedia/Items/Feather.md "wikilink")\*\*\*.
When birds are alive, they may drop [eggs](eggs "wikilink") randomly
(but only on softer terrain).

An explosion will create [debris](debris "wikilink") and some of this
may become dropped items that you may pick up.

## Notes

  - Dropped items will remain available for pickup for 1.5 (if there are
    60 or more dropped items) to about 4.94 minutes (if there is 1
    dropped item).
  - Most items will be burned and lost if you drop them in fire or
    magma. Some may explode.
  - Please note that dropping an item is NOT the same as throwing an
    item.
  - Not all animals drop items when killed. See individual
    [animal](:Category:Animals "wikilink") pages for descriptions.
