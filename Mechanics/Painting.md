__NOEDITSECTION__ Paint is a way to enhance the quality of your
home/buildings. Paints are also used to dye
[clothing](clothing "wikilink"). On this page you will find simple, easy
to follow instructions on making paint, recipes for all paint colours,
and a list of blocks that can be painted.

## Making Paints

To make paint, simply follow these steps (all paints first start with
making white paint):

1.  Be sure you have one water bucket for each bucket of paint you plan
    to create. All paints start with white paint and that starts with
    [limestone](limestone "wikilink"), so be sure to have plenty on hand
    as well as [coal](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Coal_Chunk.md "wikilink") for the
    [furnace](furnace "wikilink").
2.  [Smelt](Smelting.md "wikilink") the [limestone](limestone "wikilink")
    in the [Furnace](../Recipaedia/Items/Furnace.md "wikilink") to get [white
    pigment](White_Pigment "wikilink").
3.  Put this pigment and a [bucket of water](../Recipaedia/Tools/Water_Bucket.md "wikilink")
    together in the [furnace](furnace "wikilink") to make a white paint
    bucket.
4.  Check the table below for the recipes to make the (16) available
    paint colours.
5.  All colors need to be mixed in stages and some need more stages than
    others. To mix the colors, place the required paint bucket in the
    furnace with the specified colorant.

\- Note that once a paint bucket has been used, you cannot change the
color.

  -
    For instance, to make Cyan paint you must first make White paint
    (from limestone), then Pale Cyan paint (with malachite), then darken
    it to Cyan paint (with coal).

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Most paints have more than 1 recipe. This can make it easier to use
    paints you already have. If you are making your paints from scratch,
    look over the recipes to find the most efficient sequence.
    As an example, you can make black paint from dark grey paint and
    that from white paint. Or you can make black paint from purple
    paint, that from salmon paint, that from yellow paint and that from
    white paint. Clearly, the first way is easier and uses less
    resources.

## Ingredients Used as Colorants

These are the ingredients used to make paint. You will want to have
plenty on hand:

1.  [Limestone](../Recipaedia/Terrain/Limestone.md "wikilink") \[in [White
    Pigment](White_Pigment "wikilink")\]
2.  [Malachite Chunk](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink") \[Obtained from
    [Copper Ore](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Copper_ore.md "wikilink")\]
3.  [Sulphur Chunk](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Sulphur_Chunk.md "wikilink") \[Obtained from [Sulphur
    Ore](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Sulphur_Ore.md "wikilink")\]
4.  [Coal Chunk](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Coal_Chunk.md "wikilink")\[Obtained from [Coal
    Ore](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Coal_Ore.md "wikilink")\]
5.  [Purple Flowers](../Recipaedia/Plants/Purple_Flower.md "wikilink") \[Found randomly in
    tropical/forest biomes\]

<!-- end list -->

  -
    You will need at least one bucket and a source of water.

## Using Paint

### Painting blocks

Go to the blocks you want to paint. Prepare to paint by selecting the
paint bucket in the hotbar.

Tap the blocks you want to paint that color. It should become the same
color as the paint bucket, now.

You can paint 60 blocks with one paint bucket.

### Dyeing clothes

Take your paint bucket and put it into the furnace.

Put the piece of clothing you want to dye into the other slot in the
furnace and wait for it to finish.

Dyeing one article takes one coal chunk.

Dyeing clothes is not like paint. You can dye clothing multiple times to
combine the colors.

You can dye several pieces of clothing with one bucket.

## Blocks that can be painted

  - Some electric items use paint to color their light. They are the
    [LEDs](../Recipaedia/Electrics/LEDs.md "wikilink"), [4-LED](../Recipaedia/Electrics/4-LED.md "wikilink"), and [7-Segment
    Display](../Recipaedia/Electrics/7-Segment_Display.md "wikilink"). They can only use the
    following colors: white, yellow, red, green, blue, orange, cyan and
    purple.

Objects that may be painted or dyed are:

1.  [Clay](../Recipaedia/Terrain/Clay.md "wikilink")
2.  [Wooden Planks](../Recipaedia/Construction/Planks.md "wikilink")
3.  [Granite](../Recipaedia/Terrain/Granite.md "wikilink") - Painted Granite breaks into Painted
    Cobblestone like untreated Granite does.
4.  [Cobblestone](../Recipaedia/Construction/Cobblestone.md "wikilink")
5.  [Marble](../Recipaedia/Construction/Marble.md "wikilink")
6.  [Sandstone](../Recipaedia/Terrain/Sandstone.md "wikilink")
7.  [Basalt](../Recipaedia/Terrain/Basalt.md "wikilink")
8.  [Brick Wall](../Recipaedia/Construction/Brick_Wall.md "wikilink")
9.  [Stone Bricks](Stone_Bricks "wikilink")
10. All slabs and stairs.
11. All fences and fence gates.
12. Both [Wooden Signs](../Recipaedia/Items/Wooden_Sign.md "wikilink") and [Iron
    Signs](../Recipaedia/Items/Iron_Sign.md "wikilink")
13. All [Clothing](../Recipaedia/Clothes/Clothing.md "wikilink") made from
    [canvas](canvas "wikilink") or [leather](leather "wikilink") or
    [fur](fur "wikilink"). See the [Clothing](../Recipaedia/Clothes/Clothing.md "wikilink") page
    for more details.
14. [Carpet](../Recipaedia/Items/Carpet.md "wikilink")
15. [Electric Wire](../Recipaedia/Electrics/Electric_Wire.md "wikilink")
16. [Lightbulb](../Recipaedia/Electrics/Lightbulb.md "wikilink")

## Color Generation Chart

Thanks to user
[Artaxerxes2](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/User:Artaxerxes2)
for adding this chart\!

## Notes

  - In 2.1, Yellow was changed to Brown and Pale Yellow, to Yellow.
  - Also we have access to the color palette so all colors may be
    changed (in one world), colors can be adjusted both with RGB bars or
    using an hexadecimal value. The recipes still stay the same.
  - In 2.0 Olive has been renamed to Yellow and the original Yellow has
    been renamed to Pale Yellow.
