There are many different types of Terrain found in SurvivalCraft. It is
important that you know all of them, so you can decide where to live,
hunt, farm, and keep livestock. Certain amimals and plants are found in
different terrain types.

## Wastelands

Wastelands are flat areas with dry grass and bushes. Graves and grass
traps spawn naturally in wastelands. Some animals you can find include:
ravens, white bulls, the occasional herd of [black
cattle](Black_Cow "wikilink") , [donkeys](Donkey "wikilink") , [brown
bears](Brown_Bear "wikilink") , and occasional [black
bears](Black_Bear "wikilink") .

## Desert

Deserts are composed of sand and occasional pools of water. Although it
is most common to have fairly flat land in deserts, you can find sandy
mountains as well. Desert animals include: [lions](Lion "wikilink"),
[ostriches](Ostrich "wikilink"), [coyotes](Coyote "wikilink"),
[camels](Camel "wikilink"), [zebras](zebra "wikilink"), and
[hyenas](Hyena "wikilink").

## Cold, Snowy Areas

In snowy areas, you are likely to find different types of terrain. Some
may be flat and contain grass, others may be mountainous and have a lot
of spruce trees. This area can be good for gathering wood for your home,
but not a great place to live or keep livestock. It is not a good source
of food either. You cannot find any pumpkins, and the only animals that
live here are [reindeer](reindeer "wikilink"), the occasional herd of
[black cattle](Black_Cow "wikilink"), [white
tiger](White_Tiger "wikilink"), [polar bears](Polar_Bear "wikilink"),
[ravens](../Bestiary/Raven.md "wikilink"), and [wolves](../Bestiary/Wolf.md "wikilink"). Polar bears
are found on the ice, close to oceans and shores.

## Tropical, Lush Areas

In tropical areas, the land is mostly flat, but there are a lot of oak
trees, many of which probably contain [ivy](ivy "wikilink"). You need
ivy to obtain [string](string "wikilink"), which is vital to making a
[bow](bow "wikilink"). You can find [pumpkins](../Recipaedia/Plants/Pumpkin.md "wikilink") as
well. The animals that live here are [horses](../Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink"), cattle,
[giraffes](Giraffe "wikilink"), [rhinos](Rhino "wikilink"),
[tigers](Tiger "wikilink"), [wildboars](../Bestiary/Wildboar.md "wikilink"),
[piranhas](Piranha "wikilink") and bass in the lakes and ponds,
[gnu](gnu "wikilink"), [brown bears](Brown_Bear "wikilink") and
[ducks](Duck "wikilink"). Living in tropical areas gives you a food
advantage, but there are also many dangerous predators, example
[tigers](Tiger "wikilink"), [rhinos](Rhino "wikilink"), etc. But it is
not ideal for herding or keeping livestock. In order to do so, you must
clear away a lot of trees in order for your animals to have room in
their fence.

## Mountains

Caves are very common in mountains. In caves, you can find
[diamond](diamond "wikilink") , [coal](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Coal_Chunk.md "wikilink") ,
[iron](../Recipaedia/Items/Iron_Ingot.md "wikilink") , [malachite](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink")
, [germanium](../Recipaedia/Minerals/Germanium_Crystal.md "wikilink") . There are a lot of
resources to be found, but is is not an ideal place to live because of
it's rough terrain. You cannot keep any livestock here, and building a
house is difficult. There are also many predators that call the caves
and mountains their home such as [tigers](Tiger "wikilink") and
[brown](Brown_Bear "wikilink") and [black bears](Black_Bear "wikilink")
. There aren't very many food sources either. Only the occasional
[gnu](gnu "wikilink") or pumpkin.

## Oceans, Lakes, Ponds, and Pools

In the oceans, you will find deep, deep water infested with
[sharks](../Bestiary/Shark.md "wikilink") , rays, [barracudas](../Bestiary/Barracuda.md "wikilink") ,
and [piranhas](Piranha "wikilink") . There are also [sea
bass](../Bestiary/Sea_Bass.md "wikilink") , and if you are far out enough, an orca or
two. The orca is the most dangerous animal in the game. Once one attacks
you, you have zero chance of survival. And because they are found in the
middle of oceans, there is no land to run to. The sharks are also very
dangerous.

In the tropical lakes, you will find piranhas, brown rays, and
freshwater bass. These waters are usually 1-4 blocks deep. The piranhas
are very dangerous, and they will all gang up on you. Avoid piranha
infested waters. They can also bite your boat to the point where it can
no longer float.

In desert ponds, you will find yellow rays. Rays can dig into the sand
and dirt blocks, making them hard to spot. The yellow rays are more
dangerous than the brown rays.Yellow rays have an attack power of 5 and
brown ones 1. Desert ponds are usually 1 block deep.

Pools are also found in deserts, and sometimes tropical areas. The
difference between a pond and a pool is the size. Although they are both
only 1 block deep, ponds cover more surface area. Pools take up anywhere
from 2-8 blocks in surface area.
