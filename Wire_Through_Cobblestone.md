*A cobblestone block with a wire running across a hole drilled through
the middle. This block can conduct electricity when both ends of the
embedded wire are a connected to something. This block can be placed
with ends pointing north/south, east/west or up/down. It is very useful
when there is a need to run electricity through solid walls, or to
insulate the wire from unwanted connections with other wires.*

[wires](Electric_Wire "wikilink") to craft. You get 3 blocks.
