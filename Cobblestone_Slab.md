## DescriptionÂ (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Slabs are half-height blocks, which can be crafted from a variety of
different materials. Thay can be used to cover floors at a cheaper cost
than full size blocks. They can also be used to make long stairs, where
each unit of length moves one up by a half unit of height. Slabs can
also be affixed to the ceilings.*

## Crafting

Use 3 [cobblestone blocks](Cobblestone "wikilink") to make 4 slabs.

## Notes

  - Slabs may be placed as the bottom or top half of a block
  - When two slabs are placed in the same block space they are converted
    into a whole block.
