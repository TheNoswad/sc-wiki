![Bluehearts.png](Bluehearts.png "Bluehearts.png")Flu is a feature added
in version 2.1. It is caused when your character stays out in the cold
for too long. It is very dangerous. The temperature bar on your hotbar
indicates your body temperature. Keep it at 3-4 bars. __NOTOC__
__NOEDITSECTION__

## Description

*Flu is a dangerous condition. Your health will slowly drop down to two
hearts, making you very vulnerable. Your activities will be frequently
interrupted by coughing attacks. You will move slowly, tire easily, and
become very sleepy.*

*It is best to get to a warm place and sleep the flu off, maybe in the
morning you will get better. Flu is very difficult to cure when you are
cold.*

## Notes

  - Your hearts turn dark blue when you catch the flu.
  - Flu can be slept off in a **warm** shelter.
  - You will be much weaker, tire easier, and get sleepy when you have
    the flu.
  - A coughing attack makes you look down and pushes you back two
    blocks.

## Recommendations

Keep a [campfire](Recipaedia/Items/Campfire.md "wikilink") on you\! They are very cheap to
make and warm you up quickly. Avoid being wet. Layer your clothes.
