## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*Birch leaves grow on Birch trees and can be used to obtain Birch
saplings. They will burn and can be used as a cheap fuel. When placed
away from the trunk, they will decay.*

## Appearance Biome

Birch [Trees ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Trees)are found
in warm to cool, semi-humid climates.

## Uses

Birch Leaves can be used as fuel for
the [furnace](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Furnace) although
they are very inefficient. This is helpful early in the game. 

The recipaedia states that placed leaves will decay but that is not the
case. They can even be used to make temporary or permanent shelters if
protected from fire and lightnings.

## Notes

  - Projectiles, such as spears and arrows, will never stick into this
    block. However, they may break it.
  - Destroying leaves using a [Feather](Feather "wikilink") will cause
    it to break, but will not drop itself, making it useful for cleaning
    trees without the mess.
