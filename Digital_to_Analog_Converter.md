__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## DescriptionÂ (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

Electric DAC. Converts 4 digital signals fed to its sides to one analog
signal at the back. You need to place DAC on a
[WireThroughBlock](Wire_Through_Planks "wikilink") element to be able to
access the output signal. Can be placed on any surface and rotated to
desired orientation.

## Crafting

Crafting the DAC requires 3 [copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink") and
4 [germanium crystals](Germanium_Crystals "wikilink"). You get 4 DAC
chips.

## Hooking it up

The 4 digital input bits are on the sides of the DAC and the least
significant bit is marked by one dot, etc. They can be hooked up
normally with [wires](Electric_Wire "wikilink"). The DAC must be placed
on a wire through block to get to the output.

## Uses

  - The DAC must be used in combination with a device that accepts an
    analog input signal such as an
    [ADC](Analog_to_Digital_Converter "wikilink"), [memory
    bank](Memory_Bank "wikilink"), [digit
    display](7-Segment_Display "wikilink"), etc.

  - May be used to transmit the status of 4 different switches on a
    single wire.
  - Often used to carry address lines to memories.
