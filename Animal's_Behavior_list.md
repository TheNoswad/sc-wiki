## Notes

  - These creatures include the "Avoid Player" behavior: **grey
    wolves**, **coyotes**, ostriches, **leopards**, gnus, reindeers,
    camels, giraffes, **lions**, **hyenas**, bison, **jaguars** and
    zebras.
  - <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:22px;">Kaalus has
    implemented an advanced animal behavior mechanism. There can be
    several behaviors the animal is engaged in at one time. Each is
    assigned a value according to how critical it is to the animal and
    the most critical behavior is the one that is executed. This lets an
    air breathing animal chase you even under water but when it starts
    losing air it will stop chasing and surface to breathe. They will
    also eventually 'get bored' with chasing you and give up, if you can
    outrun them exactly one minute. (But it’s easier just to re-enter
    the world).</span>
  - Sometimes a big brawl will begin with several or many animals
    involved. It is possible for one animal to accidentally hit another
    one it was not aiming for. This can start a secondary fight between
    those 2 animals. If one is a pack animal, the same type of animal
    could join in the fight against the other. For example, one wolf
    could accidentally hit another wolf. Nearby wolves may see this and
    start attacking the first one. Other wolves may see this and then
    start attacking the new one. A big wolf-on-wolf brawl can start this
    way the same that could happen with a coyote. Any animal with the
    'defend others' behavior can wind up in this type of fight or wolves
    and lions can fight like this even though they usually just ignore
    each other.
