## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") ) 

*Strings can be made from ivy. *

## Crafting

String has two recipes. The first one requires three
[ivy](ivy "wikilink") and you get 1 string. The second requires 3
[cotton wads](Cotton_Wad "wikilink") and you get 3 strings.

## Uses

String are used as the bowstring for the [bow](bow "wikilink") or
[crossbow](crossbow "wikilink").

They are also used for making various [clothes](clothing "wikilink"),
like various pants and wooden armors. 

## Notes 

  - Much like [Feathers](Feather "wikilink"), string can be used to
    break leaf blocks without dropping leaf debris. You can avoid
    picking up a lot of leaf blocks this way.
  - Ivy is found only in the Jungle biome and may be at a cave entrance
    or even completely underground.
  - Ivy is not found on Birch Trees nor Spruce Trees.
  - Ivy can be found on Oak Trees (only).
  - Ivy can be useful for making string when the player does not have
    Saltpeter and can not produce Cotton Wads to make string.
