This article will show you how pistons can be used to make many
different automatic doorways. Often they will be 'hidden' to some
extent. Pistons can be used to make other passage related elements and
these will be included in this article as well. Included in these
elements are things such as a pathway over a deep pit, which doesn't
exist until a switch is triggered. That passage may even be removed with
pistons, after a certain amount of time...
