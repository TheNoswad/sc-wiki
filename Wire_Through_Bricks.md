## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A bricks block with a wire running across a hole drilled through the
middle. This block behaves exactly the same as bricks, but can conduct
electricity when both ends of the embedded wire are connected to
something. This block can be placed with ends pointing North/South,
East/West or Up/Down. It is very useful when there is a need to run
electricity through solid walls, or to insulate the wire from unwanted
connections with other wires.*

## Crafting

Use 6 [brick walls](Brick_Wall "wikilink") and 3 [electric
wires](Electric_Wire "wikilink"). You'll get 3 Wire through bricks.

## Use

This block is used to transfer electric signals. By using this block,
you can make your designs more compact. It will also help hide any wires
from the user. When the block is placed, the wire opening will be facing
the character.
