This guide is for starting a game in
[Challenging](Challenging_Gamemode "wikilink") or
[Cruel](Cruel_Gamemode "wikilink") gamemode. See [Beginner's
Guide](Beginner's_Guide "wikilink") for starting a game in
[Harmless](Harmless_Gamemode "wikilink") mode.

It is much easier to die in these modes, and it is very likely that you
will encounter death a number of times. For this reason, it is important
that you gather the necessary resources rather quickly. Avoiding hostile
[animals](Animals "wikilink") will also prove to be a good way to extend
your lifetime.

### Beginning the Game

As you start your gameplay, collect everything you can. Do you see any
[cotton](Cotton "wikilink"), [pumpkins](Pumpkin "wikilink"), or
[eggs](Eggs "wikilink")? If so, gather them - quickly. They will offer a
source of [clothing](:Category:Clothing "wikilink")  (for later) and
[food](:Category:Food "wikilink")  that will be vital.

Finding a place to reside can be challenging. You need to stay in a
desert for the time being so you don't freeze to death. Just make sure
you are near a forest so gathering wood isn't too risky. You don't want
to get lost or attacked by an [animal](Animals "wikilink"). 

You will  need to start to gather [wood](Oak_Wood "wikilink") to make
[planks](Planks "wikilink") for a small shelter.
[Leaves](Oak_Leaves "wikilink") or [dirt](Dirt "wikilink") will also
suffice. This will keep you safe from predators for your first few
nights while you gather supplies to make a better shelter later. Make a
[door](Wooden_Door "wikilink") for your small shelter if you wish. You
will need to make a [crafting table](Crafting_Table "wikilink")
immediately. This way you can make some [wooden
tools](:Category:Tools "wikilink")  and
[weapons](:Category:Weapons "wikilink")  to get you started. They aren't
very strong, but they will make everything easier until you get better
supplies throughout the next few days. Having a simple [wooden
machete](Wooden_Machete "wikilink") can be the difference between life
and death in challenging mode. Start to make [chests](Chest "wikilink")
to store your items as well.

Sleep at sundown. This way, if you die, you won't lose your temporary
shelter and items.

During the next few days, start to gather
[cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink"). It is mined from
[granite](Granite "wikilink") which can be found nearly everywhere. Just
make sure not to stray too far. If need be, you can make way-point
markers from leaves or dirt so you can easily find your way home. (See
[tips](Tips,_Tricks_and_Common_Mistakes "wikilink") page.)

Be sure you continue to gather [food](:Category:Food "wikilink")
 whenever you come across it\! This applies for the rest of your
journey.

Once you have enough [cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink") saved, you
can start working on your new home.

### Your New Home

For your larger home, find the flattest spot you can to lay your
foundation. Just place the [cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink") you
gathered on the [grass](Grass "wikilink") in a rectangular (or whatever
shape you desire) shape the size you want your home to be. This will
give you an idea of how many [cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink")
blocks you still need to gather. (Make [stone
tools ](:Category:Tools "wikilink") as you gather cobblestone.)

As you start to build your house higher and higher, make sure to leave
room for windows. You can use [leaves](Oak_Leaves "wikilink") for a
makeshift window until you have a [furnace](Furnace "wikilink") and
[glass](Glass "wikilink"). This will allow for you to have a placeholder
for your windows that you can still see through, but also offers
protection from predators. A [door](Wooden_Door "wikilink") will also
need to be crafted as you build your new home (if you don't have one
already).

After finishing your home and crafting a [furnace](Furnace "wikilink"),
you will need to make [chests](Chest "wikilink") to place in your new
home. Move your [crafting table](Crafting_Table "wikilink") to your new
home as well, or just craft a new one. You can label your
[chests](Chest "wikilink") with [signs](Sign "wikilink") so you know
exactly is in each one. I, for example, have some labeled "Food",
"Saltpeter", "Raw Meat", "Cooked Meat", etc. 

### Mining

You should already have stone [tools](:Category:Tools "wikilink")  and
[weapons](:Category:Weapons "wikilink")  at this point. You now need to
start gathering [iron](Iron_Ore "wikilink"),
[saltpeter](Saltpeter_Ore "wikilink"), and
[diamonds](Diamond_Ore "wikilink").

While mining with your [stone pickaxe](Stone_Pickaxe "wikilink"), pick
up ONLY [iron ore](Iron_Ore "wikilink"). Once you have enough, make an
[iron pickaxe](Iron_Pickaxe "wikilink") and continue. An [iron
pickaxe](Iron_Pickaxe "wikilink") is needed to acquire many of the ores
you will enounter (ex: [diamond ore](Diamond_Ore "wikilink")). You can
still use a [stone pickaxe](Stone_Pickaxe "wikilink") to break
[cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink") if you wish.

The biggest issue when mining is getting lost. Make sure you leave
[torches](Torch "wikilink") as markers. Don't just place the torches
randomly. They can serve as a sort of "path" for you to follow. This is
especially important when mining in a cave, as the cave may have many
tunnels to explore. 

Once you have the supplies to do so, craft a [magnet](Magnet "wikilink")
and [compass](Compass "wikilink") so you will never lose your home. The
page [Staying On Course](Staying_On_Course "wikilink") has more tips to
avoid getting lost. 

Be sure to have a [magnet](Magnet "wikilink") and
[compass](Compass "wikilink") before going any further, OR just continue
exploring a smaller amount of terrain until you get there. Way-point
markers can be used.
(See [tips](Tips,_Tricks,_and_Common_Mistakes "wikilink") page)

Now you're ready to move on to farming and obtaining [riding
animals](Rideable_Animals "wikilink")\!\!

### Obtaining Horses

[Horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink"), [Camels](Camel "wikilink"), or
[donkeys](Donkey "wikilink") will be needed as you progress. They allow
you to travel longer distances in a shorter amount of time, and help you
escape from predators faster. [Horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink") are found in
hot forest areas, [donkeys](Donkey "wikilink") and
[camels](Camel "wikilink") in the desert. To mount them, you will need a
[saddle](Saddle "wikilink"), which is crafted from
[leather](Leather "wikilink") (comes from [wolves](Wolf "wikilink") and
[coyotes](Coyote "wikilink")) and [sticks](Stick "wikilink"). You will
also need a [whistle](Whistle "wikilink"), which is crafted from [iron
ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink").

When searching for [horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink"), you can take home more
than one at a time\! (Given you have more than 1
[saddle](Saddle "wikilink"), that is). Here's how (Please note you MUST
have a [compass](Compass "wikilink") and [magnet](Magnet "wikilink") for
this method):

1.  Find a herd of [horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink"). They are usually found in
    groups of 2-5.
2.  Place a [saddle](Saddle "wikilink") on each horse.
3.  Using your [whistle](Whistle "wikilink"), lead the
    [horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink") back home. You can ride one while leading
    the others if you wish. The reason you need to have a
    [compass](Compass "wikilink") is because you will have to lead your
    [horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink") around obstacles such as cliffs, large
    hills, etc. so they do not get hurt. Chances are, you will not be
    able to use a straight path as you would with way-point markers. 
4.  When you get home, have a [fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink")
    surrounded by cheap blocks ([dirt](Dirt "wikilink"),
    [sand](Sand "wikilink"), etc.) waiting. This is so your
    [horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink") can easily get in the
    [fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink"), but not out.
    ([Fences](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") need to be 2 blocks high, as
    [donkeys](Donkey "wikilink") and [camels](Camel "wikilink") can jump
    a single [fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink").)

When only taking one [horse](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink") at a time, simply ride
your [horse](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink") home. Have a
[whistle](Whistle "wikilink") handy in case you fall off. Way-point
markers can be used here. You will not have to avoid so many obstacles. 

### Farming Crops and Animals

To [farm](Farming "wikilink") crops, you will need to collect seeds (you
should already have [cotton seeds](Cotton_Seeds "wikilink")) and a
[water](Water "wikilink") supply (do this by gathering
[water](Water "wikilink") in a [bucket](Bucket "wikilink"), or making a
well to retrieve water from.). [Fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") an area
in with [wooden fences](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") so
[animals](Animals "wikilink") cannot ruin your [soil](Soil "wikilink").
Till [dirt](Dirt "wikilink") with a [rake](Stone_Rake "wikilink") to
make [soil](Soil "wikilink"). Put
[saltpeter](Saltpeter_Chunk "wikilink") on the moisturized
[soil](Soil "wikilink") to fertilize, and place your [cotton
seeds](Cotton_Seeds "wikilink") on the [soil](Soil "wikilink"). They
will grow into [cotton plants](Cotton "wikilink"), which [cotton
wads](Cotton_Wad "wikilink") can be obtained from. You then make
[canvas](Canvas "wikilink") from the wads, and you are ready to craft
some [clothing](:Category:Clothing "wikilink") \!

Animal [farming](Farming "wikilink") is also an important aspect of
survival. For this, you will need to lay out a large
[fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") (this is why we chose a flat area to
live) 1 or 2 blocks tall (2 blocks tall will keep predators out) and put
cheap blocks such as [sand](Sand "wikilink") or
[leaves](Oak_Leaves "wikilink") around your
[fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink"). If your
[fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") is 2 blocks tall, make stairs. Throw
[tall grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink") into the
[fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink"). If there are
[cows](Black_Cow "wikilink") around, they will go right into your
[fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink")\!\! Other undesired
[animals](Animals "wikilink") may get into your
[fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") as well, such as
[gnus](Gnu "wikilink"), but you can kill them later. If no
[cows](Black_Cow "wikilink") are around, they can be obtained later with
a [whistle](Whistle "wikilink") (they run from the sound).

### Clothing

As you farm your [cotton](Cotton "wikilink"), make
[canvas](Canvas "wikilink") from the [cotton
wads](Cotton_Wad "wikilink") and put them aside in a
[chest](Chest "wikilink") for later. You also need to hunt
[animals](Animals "wikilink") that drop [fur](Fur "wikilink") and
[leather](Leather "wikilink") and set them aside too. 

Once you have enough [canvas](Canvas "wikilink") stored, you need to
make [clothing](:Category:Clothing "wikilink") . (See each individual
clothing page for crafting recipes). After crafting
[clothing](:Category:Clothing "wikilink") , you are ready to do more
intense exploring\! You can now go out as far as you like (be sure to
pack lightly. Only what you need\! This means an extra set of
[clothing](:Category:Clothing "wikilink"),
[food](:Category:Food "wikilink"), and
[weapons](:Category:Weapons "wikilink").) You can always find your way
home with your [compass](Compass "wikilink").

I do not suggest sleeping while exploring unless you make shacks with
spare [food](:Category:Food "wikilink") and a spare
[compass](Compass "wikilink") in a [chest](Chest "wikilink"). If you
die, you will go back to your last sleeping spot, and your
[compass](Compass "wikilink") will be gone. And then you won't be able
to go back home until you have mined at your new location and gathered
enough resources to make another [compass](Compass "wikilink"). You can
be out for a max of 2 days and nights before passing out. As you go
further info your adventure, you will be able to acquire enough
resources to make more [compasses](Compass "wikilink") to leave in
shacks along the way, and you will begin to become more familiar with
the [terrain](Terrain "wikilink"). All we need is just a little patience
;)
