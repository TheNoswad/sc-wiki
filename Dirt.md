## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*Dirt is a very common block found near the surface in most
environments. It can be easily dug even with bare hands, but is best dug
with a shovel. When exposed to direct sunlight, grass and flowers will
spread to it from nearby blocks, if present.*

## Notes

  - Using a rake on it will transform dirt into a
    [Soil](Soil "wikilink") block. 
  - In [adventure mode,](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink") having a
    shovel is necessary to dig dirt blocks.
  - [Brown Rays](Brown_Ray "wikilink") can be found in this block under
    lakes and ponds. They can hide on these and may sting you if you
    touch them.

## History
