## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A thin wire made of copper, it conducts electricity very well. Used for
making electric circuits. Wire can be placed on any surface and
connections with all nearby wires will be created automatically. A wire
will connect between edges of diagonally adjacent blocls. allowing you
to make hidden connections.*

The colored wire was introduced in V2.0. They behave like the [Electric
Wire](Electric_Wire "wikilink") except in how they connect to other
wires. A colored wire will not connect to wires of other colors, but
will connect to the original 'clear' wire.

## Crafting

Colored wires cannot be directly crafted - they are paintable with a
bucket much like most of the paintable blocks. See
[Painting](Painting "wikilink") for more details.

They are available for all 16 colors, however, only a few of them are in
the creative inventory (white, gray, black, blue, green, brown and red).
With 16 colors plus 'clear' wires, much more intricate electrics may now
be made. Just note that clear wires connect to all colors.

## Notes

    wires.
