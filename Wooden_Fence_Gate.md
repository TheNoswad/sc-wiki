## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Gates are used to make entrances to fenced areas. They can be opened
and closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire, gates
will open or close on the rising edge of electric signal. Animals can't
jump a fence gate.*

## Crafting

It requires 4 [sticks](stick "wikilink") and 2
[planks](planks "wikilink") to craft this gate. You will get 2 gates.

## Notes

  - Some animals can jump over fences and gates, so a doubled gate is
    needed to prevent this.
  - Wooden gates can still be opened by hand when connected to a wire.
  - They may be used for other purposes such as table or shelf supports
    or other decoration.
  - Some animals can still attack the player and/or other animals if
    both the target and the attacker are standing very close to the
    fence.

## History

  - This gate was added in the 1.22.4.0 update.
