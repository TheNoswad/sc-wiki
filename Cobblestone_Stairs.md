## DescriptionÂ (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Stairs make it easy to climb slopes. You no longer need to constantly
jump and climb vertical faces, instead you move faster, saving time and
energy. Stairs can be crafted from various materials. Stairs can also be
placed upside-down on the ceilings.*

## Crafting

Use 6 [cobblestone blocks](Cobblestone "wikilink") to craft 6 stairs.

## Notes

  - Stairs will automatically form outside corners where appropriate,
    but not inside corners. To make an inside corner, one stair has to
    be in place. Turn to face the side of it and tap the *side* of that
    stair.
  - To place them upside-down you must have a block *above* it and tap
    that block.
  - They are useful in a variety of decorative or design features.
  - Remember stairs are NOT fluid blockers and will pop if water or
    magma touches them.
