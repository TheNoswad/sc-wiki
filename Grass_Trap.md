## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*The Grass trap is a deception device that resembles grass but
disintegrates when something heavy stands on it. It's used for
concealing traps so that an animal, unwary of the trap will walk on it
and fall into the pit. It can only be crafted from oak leaves, no other
leaves will work. When placed, grass traps will turn the color of the
surrounding grass.*

## Uses

Grass traps can be used for trapping. To create a grasspit trap, a large
hole must be dug. Spiked planks can be placed at the bottom if wanted.
Animals will fall into this pit, getting trapped. The hunter can then
come and kill his catch, if the spiked planks haven't already done so.
The hunter must collect his meat quickly, as it will disappear after a
while.

## Notes

  - Grass traps can also spawn randomly in your world. For more
    information see [Grasspits](Grasspits "wikilink").
  - In a world, sometimes tall grass will spawn on top of the grass
    traps, further concealing them.
