**Survivalcraft Day One** is a free version of Survivalcraft 2 available
on Android and iOS, which allows the user to download the game
completely free of charge and try it out or have an idea before buying
the official game.

The Day One version of Survivalcraft contains exactly everything that
the official game contains, but it has some limitations.

## Limitations

  - The Day One version comes with a time limit when playing in a world,
    you can only play a world for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, a
    message will appear saying the trial period has ended and an option
    to purchase the game.
  - You cannot download worlds from the community content, nor worlds
    stored in Dropbox.
  - You cannot sleep ingame.
