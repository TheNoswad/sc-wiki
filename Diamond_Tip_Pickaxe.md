## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Pickaxes are tools for quarrying hard blocks, such as stone and ice.
They greatly speed up the quarrying process, but eventually they will
get damaged and fail. Pickaxes made of better materials will last longer
and quarry faster.*

## Crafting

Requires 3 [diamonds](Recipaedia/Minerals/Diamond.md "wikilink") and an [Iron
Pickaxe](Iron_Pickaxe "wikilink"). You get 1 pickaxe.

## Notes

  - The pickaxe does not have to be newly made to be coated with
    diamond. You can coat a worn item and it will be as good as new.
