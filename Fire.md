## Description

Fire is an entity found in Survivalcraft. You can light flammable
blocks/items\* aflame with [matches](Recipaedia/Tools/Match.md "wikilink"), [gunpowder
kegs](Recipaedia/Items/Gunpowder_Kegs.md "wikilink"), [magma](Magma "wikilink"), [fire
arrows](Recipaedia/Weapons/Fire_Arrows.md "wikilink"), [explosive
bolts](Recipaedia/Weapons/Explosive_Bolt.md "wikilink"), and lightning (summoned in [creative
mode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") only). [Animals](Bestiary/Animals.md "wikilink")
and the player can be set afire and may die if not extinguished by
[water](Water "wikilink").

If the animal normally drops meat when killed and dies while afire, the
animal will drop **cooked** meat. If they normally drop
[feathers](Recipaedia/Items/Feather.md "wikilink"), [saddles](Saddle "wikilink"),
[leather](Recipaedia/Items/Leather.md "wikilink"), or [fur](Recipaedia/Clothes/Fur.md "wikilink"), these items
burn up and will not be available to the player.Â 

\* Each block/item's individual infobox specifies whether or not it is
flammable.
