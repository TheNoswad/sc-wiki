## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A piece of raw meat. Can be consumed raw, but is much more nutritious
when cooked in a furnace.*

## Acquiring

Raw Meat is dropped by: [Black Bull](Black_Bull "wikilink"), [Black
Cow](Black_Cow "wikilink"), [Brown Bull](Brown_Bull "wikilink"), [Brown
Cow](Brown_Cow "wikilink"), [White Bull](White_Bull "wikilink"),
[Gnu](Gnu "wikilink"), [Wildboar](Wildboar "wikilink"),
[Reindeer](Reindeer "wikilink"), [Moose](Moose "wikilink"),
[Horse](Horse "wikilink"), [Donkey](Donkey "wikilink"),
[Camel](Camel "wikilink"), [Rhino](Rhino "wikilink"),
[Zebra](Zebra "wikilink"), [Giraffe](Giraffe "wikilink") and
[Bison](Bison "wikilink").

## Notes

  - If dropped when a predator is nearby, the predator will try and eat
    your meat. You can use these to lure them to a trap or such. Rotten
    meat works too.
  - You shouldn't eat raw meat, you should cook it in a
    [furnace](furnace "wikilink") before eating it. [Cooked
    meat](Cooked_Meat "wikilink") does not have any chances to cause
    [sickness](sickness "wikilink"), it is significantly more
    nutritious, and takes much longer to rot. Cooked meat is the most
    nutritious food item in the game, restoring almost the entire hunger
    bar.
  - After 3 days, it will rot and become [Rotten
    Meat](Rotten_Meat "wikilink"). Rotten meat is slightly less
    nutritious, but has a high chance of causing
    [sickness](sickness "wikilink").
