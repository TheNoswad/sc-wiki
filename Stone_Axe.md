__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Stone Axe is a primitive tool that can equally be used for digging,
cutting wood and quarrying rocks. It greatly speeds up the process, but
it will quickly get damaged and fail. Stone Axe is a poor melee weapon,
make a club if you want to fight. You should progress to specialized
tools made of metals.*

## Crafting

Requires 3 [Stone Chunks](Recipaedia/Terrain/Stone_Chunk.md "wikilink") or 1 to 3
[Cobblestone](Cobblestone "wikilink"), and two
[sticks](stick "wikilink").
