## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*An electric switch. It is used to set the state of an electric circuit
to 1 (lever up) or 0 (lever down). The voltage remains in the selected
state until the lever is moved again. A switch has outputs on all sides
for easy connection, and can be placed on any horizontal or vertical
surface.*

## Crafting

Crafting requires one [stick](stick "wikilink") and 3 [copper
ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink"). You get 4
switches.![Switch_craft.png](Switch_craft.png "Switch_craft.png")

## Hooking it Up

Simply connect any of its four sides or a WTB to an electric wire. The
output is either a constant digital 0 or 1 depending on the position of
the switch.

When the switch is placed vertically, the ON position is always UP. When
placed on a horizontal surface, ON is either North or West, depending on
the orientation. You cannot force it to be ON for the other directions. 

## Uses

  - The basic use is to let the character energize an electric circuit.
    Of course this includes such things as turning lights on and off.
  - It is NOT recommended for operating doors.
  - It is a convenient way to produce a constant '1' signal for digital
    circuits, in lieu of using a battery.
  - They can be used to make [furniture
    switches](Advanced_Furniture#Furniture_Switches_and_Furniture_Buttons "wikilink"),
    craft them with two different furnitures to make your custom
    switches.
