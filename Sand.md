## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*Sand is a yellowish loose material that covers desert areas and
beaches. Be careful because sand will collapse when tunelled under. It
is most commonly used to make glass. Cacti will often grow on it in dry
and hot climates.*

## Uses

Sand is a very bright block and can be used to keep rooms brighter with
fewer lights. 

You can smelt it in a [furnace](furnace "wikilink"). 

## Notes

  - [Gravel](Gravel "wikilink") and Sand falls at a rate of 10 blocks
    per second.
  - [Yellow Rays](Yellow_Ray "wikilink") can spawn on these in ponds and
    water areas. They hide and may sting you if you touch them.
