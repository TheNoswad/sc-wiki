This article presents timer circuits. Timers (as opposed to alarms) do
not start automatically and either count elapsed time (stopwatch) or
count down from a preset value (cooking timer). They may still trigger
an alarm but only *after* a certain *amount* of time has elapsed.

All references in this article to 'seconds', 'minutes', etc mean
SurvivalCraft 'seconds' etc. These are defined by the [Real Time
Clock](Recipaedia/Electrics/Real_Time_Clock.md "wikilink") outputs.

## Day Counter

This circuit will keep track of the number of days since it was started
up. It can be used to keep track of how long you are in a mine or to
make sure you visit your animals regularly.

### Operation

The day counter never stops. It constantly increases by one at midnight.
You can tap the reset button to set the count to 0. It will start
counting the number of days that pass.

### How it works

The [RTC](Recipaedia/Electrics/Real_Time_Clock.md "wikilink") (real time clock) output 3
indicates the hours with an analog signal. At midnight this signal
changes from full on (F) to full off (0). This change is detected and
inverted by the [NOT](Recipaedia/Electrics/Logic_NOT_Gate.md "wikilink") gate and that triggers
the (+) input on the [4-Bit Counter](4-Bit_Counter "wikilink"). The
output of the counter feeds the [7-Segment
Display](Recipaedia/Electrics/7-Segment_Display.md "wikilink").

The [button](button "wikilink") is connected to the reset input on the
4-bit counter.

The back of the day counter.

### Building it

As you can see, this timer is very simple to build. It only requires 1
RTC, 1 counter, 1 NOT gate, 1 display, 1 button, 1 wire, 3 [wire-through
blocks](Recipaedia/Electrics/Wire_Through_Planks.md "wikilink"), and 1 other block.

The design above was laid out for minimum space and components. It can
easily be adapted so that it's all hidden except the button and display.

### Use

The picture below shows one application of the Day Timer. On the top is
a clock with date display. The timer is below. With this setup, I can
see what the date and time are now and hit the reset before I go to
mine. Then when I get back, I'll know how long I was away as well as the
current time and date. The werewolf early warning circuit (see [Alarm
circuits](Alarm_circuit "wikilink")) can be added to the back of this
since there are no "player serviceable parts" to it.

## Stopwatch Timer

Here is a circuit for a minimum functioning stopwatch. You can start and
stop it and reset it to zero. It reads out in SC hours/minutes/seconds.

### Operation

The start/stop switch will stop and freeze the stopwatch when it is off
(down). The stopwatch will begin again from that value when the switch
is on (up).

Tap the reset button to set the timer back to all '0's. You can reset it
when the timer is stopped or is running.

### Building the stopwatch

Look at the 3 pictures provided. They show the front, back and side view
of a working model. With enough electrics experience you can rebuild one
from these pictures. However, it is not considered a simple circuit and
a link to a map including this circuit will be provided shortly...

The circuit is laid out in the pictures such that you can build the
display and switches into the face of a wall.

All unnecessary block are removed for

### How it works

There are 3 parts to this design. It starts with the 'oscillator'
section which generates a pulse each second. The (analog) seconds output
from an [RTC](Recipaedia/Electrics/Real_Time_Clock.md "wikilink") is fed to an
[ADC](Analog_to_Digital_Converter "wikilink") to strip out the least
significant bit - the fastest one. First it is gated through an AND gate
so it can be turned off by the switch.

This bit *changes state* each second so is processed by a differentiator
cuircuit as shown on the [Clock / Pulse
Circuits](Clock_/_Pulse_circuits "wikilink") page. From the diff
circuit,Â  we get a pulse every second (or 1 Hz).

The one per second clock goes into a 3 stage counting circuit. The first
counter is for the seconds. It is chained into the minutes counter which
is chained into the hours counter. All 3 counters are reset to '0' when
the reset switch is tapped.
