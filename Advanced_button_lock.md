*NOTE: If you want easier lock, try [5-pin lever
lock](5-pin_lever_lock "wikilink").*

## **Description**

This is advanced button lock. It is harder to unlock than any other
locks I know. It is made from parts, I'm calling them counters (if you
want to know more about them, visit
[this](http://survivalcraft.lefora.com/2013/07/08/tutorial-for-intricate-timers-and-score-keeping-sy/)
page - mgblitz81 explains it well). You can see one counter here.

<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:21px;">Now comes the question,
why am I calling it "advanced". Well, this can be the answer:</span>

You have to press **button 1 two times**, then **button 3 three times**
and then **button 2 (one time)**. If you will press button 2 more times,
all clicks will be reseted (but you won't know it). And there could be
also TNT added (so if you will press any button more times than it
should be pressed, you will explode). Button 4 is just for reset (if you
will get lost in the buttons presses number).

<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:21px;">Due to the complicated
functions, it is almost impossible to tell you how to do it. I will
instead give you a link to it, so you can download it and look at it
from all diresctions. The map include also </span>[5-pin lever
lock](5-pin_lever_lock "wikilink")<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:21px;">,
counter (the one you can see on the first picture) andÂ </span>[binary
counter](binary_counter "wikilink")<span style="font-size:13px;line-height:21px;">.
