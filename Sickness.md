Sickness is a feature added in version 2.1. It is caused by eating moldy
food, raw food, [Sea Urchins](Sea_Urchins "wikilink") or eating the same
food for too long. It is very dangerous and leaves you
vulnerable.![Nauseus.png](Nauseus.png "Nauseus.png") __NOTOC__
__NOEDITSECTION__

## Description

*When you eat [raw meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink"), uncooked eggs, [Sea
Urchins](Sea_Urchins "wikilink") or any food that has been allowed to
rot, the player may become sick.*

*Sickness is an unpleasant condition. Your health will slowly drop down
to a single heart, making you very vulnerable. Your activities will be
constantly interrupted by tossing cookies and nausea attacks. You will
move slowly, be weak and tire easily. You will not be able to eat
certain food types.*

*It is best to sleep it off, maybe in the morning your stomach will get
better.*

## Notes

  - A tossing cookies (vomiting) attack lasts 2 seconds. You are
    immobilized and must wait it out. It decreases your health but will
    not kill you.
  - A nausea attack lasts one second and while you are able to move,
    your vision goes green; making it very difficult to see.
  - Consuming **any** food when sick causes you to have a tossing
    cookies (vomiting) or nausea attack. So although sickness won't kill
    you, hunger can.
  - Your character begins to move slower, isÂ weaker and tires easier.
  - Sickness can weaken you so much that a single hit or minor fall will
    finish you off.
  - You can become so weak that you are unable to extricate yourself
    from even a single block of water. If you have wooden armor, this
    will help you float and may allow you to get out of the water even
    when very weak.
  - Sanitation is saved separately for each type of food. Satiation
    increases by nutrition value, or 0.5 if [nutrition
    value](Top_5_Things_to_Have_at_All_Times "wikilink") is less than
    0.5. If satiation after eating food is more than 3.5, sickness
    begins. Satiation decreases by 0.5 per in-game day (20 real
    minutes).
  - Blocks and items are changed simultaneously every [Rot
    period](Top_5_Things_to_Have_at_All_Times "wikilink") minutes, but
    the exact moments of change are different. When the world is
    created, items begin to change after a minute of real time, unlike
    blocks. Rot is disabled in [Creative](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink")
    and [Adventure](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink") and for everything
    whose Rot period \<= 0. Rotting ones have 2
    [stages](Hacking_The_Project_File#Obtaining_items_and_blocks_that_are_missing_in_the_creative_inventory "wikilink"):
    fresh and stale. The rotten ones go through the same 2 stages.

## Recommendations

Vary your diet. Grow many crops in your farms such as
[pumpkins](Pumpkin "wikilink") or [rye](Rye "wikilink"). Take advantage
of laid eggs around you, have cattle near your home and milk cows. Do
not under any circumstance consume rotten items\! Avoid raw food as much
as possible. It is best to cook food.
