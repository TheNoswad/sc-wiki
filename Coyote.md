## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A medium sized predatory animal that lives in deserts. Moves fast and
hunts in packs at night. Will sometimes stop and howl raising its head
high to the moon. During the day is shy and will move away from trouble.
Extremely dangerous at night when encountered in large numbers. Will
smell prey from large distances and congregate to hunt it."*

## Description

<span style="font-size:14px;">Coyotes are dog-like mammals in
Survivalcraft with a golden and sepia pelt.</span>

They are carnivores, meaning they will
eat: [Meat ](Raw_Meat "wikilink")\[raw or
cooked\], [Bird ](Raw_Bird "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\],
and [Fish ](Raw_fish "wikilink")\[raw or cooked\].

Coyotes are very shy during the day but will attack if they seem
threatened but, in the night they will attack you on sight. They drop
1-3 [Leather](Leather "wikilink") when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Coyotes are found in Deserts and hunt and live in packs.

## Uses

Because coyotes drop leather when killed, which is vital for clothing,
they are quite useful when hunted. 

Coyote can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)
