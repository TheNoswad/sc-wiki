## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*Stone bricks can be made by binding together several stones of regular
shape. They are a strong building material, very resilient to explosions
and digging.*

## Crafting

Use 4 blocks of either [granite](granite "wikilink") or
[cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink") to craft stone bricks. You get 4
stone bricks.

## Use

Stone brick is highly decorative and can be made into
[slabs](Stone_Slab "wikilink") and [stairs](Stone_Stairs "wikilink").
They have a high explsion resilience so are suitable for building
protective walls.

## Notes

  - Stone bricks can be made without a [crafting
    table](Crafting_Table "wikilink").
  - You can use any combination of granite and cobblestone to craft
    them.
