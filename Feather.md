## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Feathers come from birds' tails and can be used as stabilizers in
arrows.*

## Uses

  - Feathers are used in making [arrows](Wooden_Tip_Arrow "wikilink")
    and [bolts](Iron_Bolt "wikilink")
  - Can be used as a very inefficient fuel for a furnace.

## Notes

  - Feathers can be used to break leaf blocks without dropping leaf
    debris. You can avoid picking up a lot of leaf blocks this way. 
  - Ostriches and Cassowarys offer the most feathers, dropping 4-6 when
    killed.
  - If a bird is killed by fire or an explosion, feathers will be burned
    and not dropped.
