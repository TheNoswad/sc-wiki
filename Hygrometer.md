## DescriptionÂ (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

Hygrometer displays humidity of the surrounding area. It is an important
tool when planting trees. All trees need a lot of humidity to grow. When
a tree is planted an area which is too dry, the sapling will wilt. It is
also an electric element that outputs analog signal corresponding to the
surrounding humidity.

## Crafting

Use 2 [iron ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink") and 3 [malachite
chunks](Malachite_Chunk "wikilink") to craft one hygrometer.

## Notes

This must be an old-fashioned type of hygrometer and actually displays
the dryness rather than the humidity. A higher humidity drives the
needle to the left and a drier reading moves the needle to the right.

The hygrometer can be connected to an electric circuit and will output
an analog signal proportionate to the humidity:

## History

  - 1.14- Added the Hygrometer. Its uses are to show humidity so trees
    could grow.
  - 1.23- Hygrometers now produce an analog signal.
