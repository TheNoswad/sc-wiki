## Description

Cattle farming can be used to obtain milk, a constant food source,
although cattle can later be slaughtered for meat if necessary. As of
the 1.26 update, having bulls around your house can also reduce the
amount of aggressive animals you awake to.

The video below is Kaalus's view on cattle farming:

## How to Farm Cattle?

First build a fenced area to contain the cattle. Use open gates or
blocks placed next to the fence to allow cattle into the fenced area. To
herd cattle, you can blow whistles, which they will run away from into
the other direction. An alternative to move cattle is to use tall grass
as bait. Hitting cattle isn't very effective since cows will run away
from you whilst bulls will attack you. Use a bucket to collect milk from
a cow by tapping the cow with the bucket while keeping yourself safe
from bulls (e.g. milk cows from the other side of the fence). After a
cow has been milked once you will need to wait for it to regenerate milk
before you can milk it again. Black cows will regenerate milk faster
than brown cows. ![Black_cow.png](Black_cow.png "Black_cow.png")



## Keep Your Bulls

As of the 1.26 update it is important to keep bulls with your cows and
make sure that they are all the same color. Although bulls will try to
attack you if you milk or accidentally hit one of their cows they are
necessary to protect cows from animal attacks. Having several bulls of
the same color is best since bulls of the same color will gang up on
anyone messing with a cow of the same color. Fences will not always
provide sufficient protection for cows since many aggressive animals,
especially werewolves and tigers, can at times find ways to jump fences.
Also aggressive animals may spawn inside the fenced area. Not having a
few bulls around will almost inevitably lead to a dead herd.

## Notes

  - Cattle run away from the sound of a whistle, as do
    [ostriches](Ostrich "wikilink") and [birds](Raven "wikilink").
  - Cattle will come after [tall grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink") and
    [flowers](Red_Flower "wikilink") to eat them when dropped as items.
  - You can gather milk from cows using a [Bucket](Bucket "wikilink").
  - Cattle also run away from the sound of an explosion creating an
    effect on the entire herd of cows.
  - Bulls will attack you if you hit a cow.
  - Bulls will only guard their own cows; [Black
    Bull](https://survivalcraftgame.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Bull)s only
    protect [Black Cows](Black_Cow "wikilink") and [Brown
    Bulls](https://survivalcraftgame.fandom.com/wiki/Brown_Bull) only
    protect [Brown Cows](Brown_Cow "wikilink"). There are no completely
    white cows and as such the rare white bull is less useful than its
    counterparts, although can be kept with other cows for alternative
    carnivore bait.
