## Description

Survivalcraft has small patches of paradise in the vast ocean, named
islands. They can range in size from as little as one block, to hundreds
of blocks. Depending on the map, some may be easily accessible or it may
be difficult to find even one. Islands may be like miniature mainlands;
caves, trees, and all matter of different biomes are possible. Animals
rarely spawn on smaller islands, except for birds, making them
relatively safe from hostile and semi-hostile animals. Larger islands
can spawn animals prodigiously.

## Finding an island

Isolated islands can be found out in the ocean. To reach one in survival
mode, [Boats](Recipaedia/Items/Boats.md "wikilink") must be used. This is because the player
can't swim for long periods of time, as they will get tired and drown.
It is recommended more then one boat and durable weapons are brought on
the journey, as dangerous predators like piranhas, sharks, and orcas
will attack you. See the [boat page](Recipaedia/Items/Boat.md "wikilink") for information on
combat in boats.n
