## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"Bottom-dwelling fish, lives both in salt and freshwater. Will often
bury itself in the mud at the bottom with only the head sticking out.
Not aggressive, but has a poisonous sting that will severely injure
anyone who steps on it. Delicious to eat."*

## Description

Rays are underwater animals. The Yellow Ray is yellow in color.

As of current, you are unable to feed the rays, and they drop 1 [Raw
Fish](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_fish) when killed.

Rays are hostile, especially when you step on them. They have the
ability to dig into the bottom of the lakes, making them almost
invisible:

downside is that they are hard to see when the dig into the lake beds.
