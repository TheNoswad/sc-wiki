This page describes the parameters used in the infobox for tools and
weapons. 

Any entry that does not apply should be left blank. Some entries have a
default value that will be used if no other value is entered. 

## Basic Information

**Title:** What's the name of this tool? 

'''Image: '''Enter the name of the 'icon' image file. 

'''Image Width: '''Only enter a value here if the default (120 px)  does
not work. 

'''Caption: '''You may add a caption to go under the image. Usually
leave it blank. 

## Common Attributes

**Is Stackable:** How many can you carry in inventory?   Default is 1,
so usually leave blank. 

**Is Flammable:** Can this tool catch fire?   (Yes or No) 

**Density:** Used to determine buoyancy. An item with a density less
than 1 will float. Item with density greater than 1 will sink.

'''Durability: '''How long does the tool or weapon last? The final value
depends also on the hardness of the blocks it is used on. 

## <span style="font-size:20px|color:red;">Weapon Powers</span>

**Melee Power:** How much damage does it do when hitting with it? 

**Melee Ratio**: What is the chance of a strike when hitting with it?
 Is a number between 0 (never hits) and 1 (always hits). 

**Ranged Power:** How much damage does it do when thrown? 

**Explosive Power:** Power of the explosion provided by it. (Bombs) 

## <span style="font-size:20px;">Tool Strengths</span>

'''Tool Level: '''Indicates the level of the tool. Certain minerals will
require a minimal level to be acquired.

  - 1 means you can acquire it by hand.
  - Wooden tools are level 2
  - Stone tools are level 3
  - Copper Tools are level 4
  - Iron tools are level 5
  - Diamond tools are level 6

**Digging Power:**  Effectiveness when used as a shovel. 

**Hack Power:**  Effectiveness when used as an axe. 

**Quarry Power:** Effectiveness when used as a pickaxe. 

*NOTE:* do not add values for the above powers unless the tool is
intended for the use. All other uses have a default power of 1.5 -
slightly better than 'by hand'.
