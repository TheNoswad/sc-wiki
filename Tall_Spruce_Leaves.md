## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

Tall Spruce Leaves grow on tall spruce trees and can be used to obtain
tall spruce saplings. They will burn and can be used as a cheap fuel.
When placed away from the trunk, they will decay.

## Apperance Biome

Tall Spruce trees are found in cold, wet [biomes](Biomes "wikilink").

## Uses

They can be used as fuel for the [furnace](Furnace "wikilink") although
they are very inefficient. This is helpful early in the game. If one is
put into a [crafting table](Crafting_Table "wikilink"), it will become a
tall spruce sapling.

## Notes

  - You do not need special tools to gather leaf blocks unless you are
    playing in [adventure mode.](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink")
  - The recipaedia states that placed leaves will decay but that is not
    the case. They can even be used to make temporary or permanent
    shelters if protected from fire and lightnings.
  - Destroying leaves using a [Feather](Feather "wikilink") will cause
    it to break, but will not drop itself, making it useful for cleaning
    trees without the mess.
