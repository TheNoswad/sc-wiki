## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Old pants you wore when being abandoned on this land. Can be Dyed. No
Protection. Weak Insulation.*

## Notes

Cannot be crafted. These are the pants you start the game with. If you
die and respawn, the pants will be gone and you will be left with just
the shorts on the default skin.
