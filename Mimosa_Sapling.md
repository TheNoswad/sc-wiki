## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Saplings are used to plant trees. You can obtain them by crafting from
the leaves of trees. When planting, be careful to place the saplings in
a well lit place, full of moisture and of correct temperature. Use
hygrometer and thermometer to measure these quantities. Oaks like it
warm, Birches moderately cool, Spruces cold and Mimosa's hot. All trees
need a lot of humidity. If you plant a sapling in a wrong spot, it will
wilt into a dry bush.*

## Crafting

To obtain Mimosa Saplings, put Mimosa Leaves in
the [Workbench](Workbench "wikilink"). Each leaf yields one sapling.
