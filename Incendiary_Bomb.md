## DescriptionÂ (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*An incendiary bomb is a sphere made of iron filled with gunpowder and
fitted with a slow-burning fuse. It will explode a few seconds after it
is thrown. It is weaker than a regular bomb, but its debris set
flammable objects on fire. Do not use in the wooded areas\!*

## Crafting

You need One [Bomb](Bomb "wikilink") and one [Sulfur
Chunk](Recipaedia/Minerals/Sulfur_Chunk.md "wikilink"). You get 1 incendiary.

## Use

Select it in the hotbar. Aim and throw it like a stone chunk. After it
lands, a 5 second delay fuse will start then--BOOM\! Watch out for
flaming debris\!

## Notes

  - You can start a house or forest fire if used carelessly.
  - Red flaming debris can be spread far from the initial explosion and
    can set on fire anything that's flammable.
  - Their explosive power is 50, less than a small gunpowder keg so
    they're not very effective against stone and other hard materials.
  - They will scare animals, especially birds, from the area.
  - It is better to use this against soft materials rather than hard
    materials such as stone.
  - Successful mining explosions only drop about 75% of the total
    blocks.

## History

  - Added in Survivalcraft 2.0
