## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Spruce leaves grow on Spruce trees and can be used to obtain Spruce
saplings. They will burn and can be used as a cheap fuel. When placed
away from the trunk, they will decay. During Christmas time, a Christmas
tree can be crafted from them.*

## Apperance Biome

Spruce trees are found in cold, snowy [biomes](Biomes "wikilink") .

## Uses

Spruce Leaves can be crafted into a [Christmas
Tree](Christmas_Tree "wikilink") (any time of year). 

They can be used as fuel for the[furnace](Furnace "wikilink") although
they are very inefficient. This is helpful early in the game. 

## Notes

  - You do not need special tools to gather leaf blocks unless you are
    playing in [adventure mode.](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink") 

<!-- end list -->

  - The recipaedia states that placed leaves will decay but that is not
    the case. They can even be used to make temporary or permanent
    shelters if protected from fire and lightnings.
  - Destroying leaves using a [Feather](Feather "wikilink") will cause
    it to break, but will not drop itself, making it useful for cleaning
    trees without the mess.
