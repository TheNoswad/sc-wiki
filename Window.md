## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

A glass block can be made stronger and more decorative by framing it in
wooden sticks. Perfect for making windows.

## Crafting

![Craft_window.jpg](Craft_window.jpg "Craft_window.jpg")A window
requires 4 [sticks](Stick "wikilink") and one [glass
block](Glass "wikilink") to craft.

You get one window.

## Notes

  - Much like standard Glass, It will shatter if a block of sand or
    gravel falls on top of it.

<!-- end list -->

  - Combining [framed glass](Framed_Glass "wikilink") with windows and
    [glass](glass "wikilink") can create interesting patterns.

<!-- end list -->

  - The recipaedia suggests that a window is stronger than glass but the
    specs are the same for glass, framed glass and the window.

<!-- end list -->

  - Framed glass and windows drop sticks.
