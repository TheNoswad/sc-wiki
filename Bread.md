## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A loaf of bread. Very tasty and nutritious meal.*

## Crafting

Bake [Dough](Dough "wikilink") in a [furnace](furnace "wikilink") to
make bread. You get one loaf. ![Craft_bread.jpg](Craft_bread.jpg

## Making Bread from Scratch

There are 6 steps to making Bread.

1.  **Gather many [wild rye seeds](wild_rye_seeds "wikilink") from [Wild
    Rye](Wild_Rye "wikilink").** You should have several full stacks at
    your disposal.
2.  **Prepare the field.** You must properly prepare a large field for
    growing. The temperature of the field must be in the mid ranges and
    the humidity must be high enough, for crops to grow. Using
    a [thermometer](thermometer "wikilink") and [hygrometer](hygrometer "wikilink") will
    help. Place double fences around the field since animals can easily
    destroy your crops by walking over them. It is helpful to have
    [water](water "wikilink") within a few blocks of each and every
    block that is to be seeded. Prepare the ground with [a
    rake](Wooden_Rake "wikilink") to turn it
    into [soil](soil "wikilink"). Fertilize the soil with
    [saltpeter](Recipaedia/Minerals/Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink") . 
3.  '''Sow the rye seeds and wait for them to reach FULL maturity.
    '''This may take a long time and some seeds may not grow. This will
    produce [rye](rye "wikilink") (not WILD rye). Refer to the page
    [rye](rye "wikilink") for more details. Harvest the rye to gather
    [rye seeds](rye_Seeds "wikilink").
4.  **Take these (domestic) [rye](rye "wikilink") seeds and craft them
    into [flour](flour "wikilink").** A [crafting
    table](Crafting_Table "wikilink") is needed. Nine seeds make one
    measure of flour. 
5.  **Take the [flour](flour "wikilink") and craft that into
    [dough](dough "wikilink"). **You will need a [Water
    Bucket](Water_Bucket "wikilink") for each lump of dough. 
6.  **Take the dough and bake it into bread.** Uses a
    [furnace](furnace "wikilink").

## Notes

  - Bread is the most complicated and time consuming food in
    SurvivalCraft, and it requires rye seeds, coal and saltpeter which
    can be difficult to find. You will need at least about 40 plants to
    even hope to grow enough to sustain the character and may need to
    constantly scout for saltpeter for fertilizer.
  - Cooked Ostrich and Cassowary [Eggs](Egg "wikilink"),
    [Fish](Cooked_Fish "wikilink") and [Bacon](Cooked_Bacon "wikilink")
    are more nutritious than bread. Bread is as nutritious as [Cooked
    Bird](Cooked_Bird "wikilink").
  - Bread left alone for a while may rot and turn into [Moldy
    Bread](Moldy_Bread "wikilink").
  - Boars and bears will try to eat it remains.
