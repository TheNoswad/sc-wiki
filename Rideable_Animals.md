__NOEDITSECTION__

There are three rideable animals; the horse, camel, and donkey.
Attempting to ride horses and or camels without a saddle will result in
you getting thrown off. Not a good idea\! You can get on a donkey
without a saddle and without getting bucked off, but he will not move.

## [Horse](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink")

Horses are the fastest rideable animal. Placing a saddle on a horse
allows you to ride it. Can be great for quick escapes from dangerous
animals. They are the most common rideable animal. The most stubborn
horses are black horse. Palomino horses are never stubborn. They come in
a range of different colors including Bay, Chesnut, Palomino, White and
black.

## [Camel](Camel "wikilink")

Camels are considerably slower and rarer than horses, but they drive
nicely. They are sometimes called the ships of the desert. They are most
commonly found in desert biomes and their borders. Camels can also jump
up to two blocks high, so when containing them a high wall/fence is
needed. They also take less damage from hits. Be careful as they are
taller, you can easily hit your head on short trees and fall from your
camel.

## [Donkey](Donkey "wikilink")

The donkey is the rarest and most stubborn rideable animal. They can be
found in grassland biomes most commonly. Donkeys will not try to throw
you off their backs if mounted without a saddle, but will refuse to
move. When riding a donkey, it will often stop and shake it head.
Feeding the donkey some kind of plant material (flower, grass) will
ensure longer riding. Donkeys take less damage from fire and falls.

## Saddling Your Animal

Hold a [saddle](saddle "wikilink") in your hand and walk up close to the
animal. Tap the animal and the saddle will be placed on it. You don't
have to do anything special for the animal to accept the saddle.
Survivalcraft world animals don't need to be trained or 'broken' to
allow a saddle on them. Make sure you have the saddle in hand, or you
will punch the animal, and horses and donkeys may run, but camels
attack\!

## Mounting Your Animal

Approach the (saddled) animal and keep it in the center of your
viewscreen. When you are close enough, the crouch button will turn into
a MOUNT button. Simply press this button and you will get atop the
animal and be ready to ride it.

## Guiding Your Animal

It can take some practice to learn how to guide your ride and steer it
properly.We recommended getting used to this in either creative or
harmless mode. That way you won't have to worry about getting hurt while
you learn.

You do not have to keep pressing forward for the ride to keep moving.
Each time you swipe forward (up) it will pick up speed until it's moving
at the maximum speed. The same goes for slowing down. If you are moving
fast, you will have to swipe down several times to stop completely.

Turning is not the same. Swipe sidewise to turn. As long as you keep
your finger on the screen the ride will continue to turn. The bigger
your swipe, the faster it will turn. When you lift your finger, it will
keep going in the direction it is facing.

## Summoning Your Animals

Any [saddled](Saddle "wikilink") animal within 30 blocks will come to
you when you summon them with a whistle. A [whistle](whistle "wikilink")
also works for herding cows, ostriches and unsaddled camels. (They will
run away from the whistle). To blow your whistle, have it in your hand
and tap anywhere on the screen (unless if the whistle is hitting a block
\[you are hitting a thing\]).

## Stubbornness

If the animal is hungry or not saddled, every second there is a chance
that it will resist the rider.

| Animal         | Stubborn Probability |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Palomino horse | 0                    |
| Other horses   | 0.00125              |
| Camel          | 0.0025               |
| Saddled Donkey | 0.025                |
| Donkey         | 0.5                  |

Stubbornness lasts 1 to 2 minutes, but later a new one may begin.
Therefore, the best solution is to feed, for example, a flower, tall
grass, sapling, or moldy bread.

Saturation is spent for 1 every 100 in-game seconds. 1 item adds 1
saturation. Animals lose interest in food if saturation is \>= 1. As
soon as they eat 1 item, their saturation becomes slightly less than 1,
so you can feed more.

Saturation is not saved when quitting the world, that is, it is equal to
zero when the world loads, so you should not feed before quitting.
