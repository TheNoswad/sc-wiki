## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Arrows and [bolts](bolts "wikilink") are fired from projectile weapons*

## Crafting

Requires an [iron tip arrow](Iron_Tip_Arrow "wikilink") and
1 [diamond](diamond "wikilink"). You get 1 arrow. 

Arrows may be made in the [personal crafting
interface](Crafting "wikilink").![Diamond_Tip_Arrow.png](Diamond_Tip_Arrow.png

## Uses

Arrows are shot from a [bow](bow "wikilink"). They are especially good
for killing animals that are hard to melee kill such as birds, or for
when severely injured animals run away so you can land the killing blow.

## Notes

  - All projectiles have a chance to break or bounce back when hitting
    something.
  - This is the most dangerous arrow when it bounces back to you as it
    will kill you on one shot.
