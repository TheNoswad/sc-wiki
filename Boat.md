## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*The boat allows you to cross large areas of water safely and quickly.*

## Description

Boats are vehicles used to travel on water. They will let you travel
long distances on water without drowning. They are really helpful when
going to islands out in the ocean. They are the only water based mode of
transportation in Survivalcraft. But be cautious while in your boat,
piranhas and sharks can attack and destroy your boat.

## Crafting

It takes 5 planks to craft one boat.

## Using it

The boat is one item you should be very careful with when it's in your
hotbar. This is because once it's placed, you cannot pick it up again.

  - To place the boat, move it into the hotbar. When you are ready to
    place the boat, just select it and tap on the spot you want the
    boat.

<!-- end list -->

  - Movement of the boat is similar to riding a horse. Use the MOVE pad
    and swipe upwards and keep pressing. The boat will move forward.
    Move your finger to one side and the boat will turn. Move it back to
    center to go straight.
  - You can run the boat aground to keep it from floating away. However,
    animals may knock it back into the water, or even push it farther
    onto land.
      - Be careful when the boat is on ground because you have to be
        able to get 'behind' it, to push it back into the water. You
        could push it into a corner and have to break blocks in order to
        get 'behind' it.

## Notes

  - You can avoid sharks or piranhas damaging your boat or killing you.
    When they are near, simply  dismount the boat (tap the horse icon).
    You will now be standing ON the boat instead of IN it. The animals
    will believe the boat is empty and that you are now on land. Wait
    until they clear the area and then mount the boat and continue on
    your way\!   (Thanks to mrshots, on the forum for this tip) As of
    version 1.26, animals may attack the block you are standing on, in
    this case The boat. However the boat is also stronger.
  - It is a good idea to carry an extra boat. If you fall in the water
    with armor on, you can place the boat under you and it will lift you
    to the surface.
  - Boats are the only means of transportation on water
  - Boats are unique in block type as they are solid but can still be
    moved.
  - Like magnets and creatures, the player can only place so many boats
    in the world and this message will appear.

  - Boats can take damage like animals and the player. If damaged enough
    (\[0.33;0.66) HP), the boat will begin to "leek" and will start to
    slow down a lot. Should the boat continue to receive more damage
    ((0;0.33) HP), it will fail to move and slowly sink into the water,
    leaving the player wet and unprotected to the water predators.
  - Beginning in V2.0, boats have 50% more strength.
  - Beginning in V2.0,the character may spawn in a boat.

  - Be careful when debarking a boat. If you are not standing still, you
    could stand up in the water instead of staying in the boat. Since
    version 2.1, the boat tends to be unstable when debarking it. It may
    jump away as you debark and dump you in the water. It's now
    advisable to be moving the character backward onto land when you hit
    the mount button.
  - Tip: Do not leave your damaged boats to rot\! In a few days, they
    will restore their health, just like the player does and animals\!
    This seems to work in both versions: I (Trapmacer) tested this in
    SC1, and Stanimus affirmed that it works in SC2\! The more severely
    damaged the boat is, the longer it will take to heal back to normal
    speed and strength.

## History

  - Boats were added in 1.22
