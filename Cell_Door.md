## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Doors are used to make entrances to buildings. They can be opened and
closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire, doors will
open and close on the rising edge of an electrical signal. Iron or cell
doors cannot be operated when electrically connected.*

## Crafting

To craft a cell door, you will need 6 Iron [Rods](Rod "wikilink").

    your home.
  - Can be activated with electric circuits. If connected to a circuit,
    you cannot open it by hand.
