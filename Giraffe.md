## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A very large and tall plant eating mammal. Very strong but docile.
Dangerous when decides to defend itself instead of fleeing. Lives in
warm areas. Delicious to eat and provides plenty of meat."*

## Description

The giraffe is a mammal in Survivalcraft and is the tallest animal in
the game thus far. Because of their large size and bright yellow and
orange color, they are easy to spot in forests.

Giraffes are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Red
Flowers](Red_Flower "wikilink"), [Purple
Flowers](Purple_Flower "wikilink"), [White
Flowers](White_Flower "wikilink"), [Tall Grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink"),
and [Ivy](Ivy "wikilink").

They are non-hostile\*\*, and drop up to 6 meat when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Giraffes are primarily found in jungles and forests, although you may
occasionally find one that has strayed into a desert or wasteland.

## Uses

Giraffes drop a whopping 6 meat when killed, however they are extremely
dangerous if they decide to fight back. They do more damage than a wolf
and can leave serious injury to reckless players.

Giraffe can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Gamemode)
using a [Spawner
Egg.](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs)

\*\*This animal is GENERALLY passive, but  it may retaliate when
injured.
