__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Logic NOR gate. Has two input on the sides and one output. The output
is 0 when any of the inputs is 1, otherwise it is 1. Can be placed on
any surface and rotated to desired orientation.*

## Crafting

Crafting requires 2 copper ingots, 5 germanium crystals. You get 4
gates.

## Hooking It Up

### Connections

The output is the side where the 'pointy' end is. The inputs are the
sides next to that one. The opposite side has no connection.

### Graphical Symbol

This gate is a standard [OR gate](Logic_OR_Gate "wikilink") with a
built-in [NOT gate](Logic_NOT_Gate "wikilink") after it. This helps to
reduce circuit complexity.

## Notes

  - NOR gates are primarily digital devices but will operate on analog
    signals. It performs a bitwise NOR. This allows for more compact and
    interesting circuit designs. See [Using Analog
    Signals](Using_Analog_Signals "wikilink").
