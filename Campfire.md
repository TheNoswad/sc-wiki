## <span style="font-size:20px;">Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))</span>

*The Campfire is easy to construct, provides heat, light, and keeps
predators away. You can make it bigger by throwing combustible items on
top, such as sticks, leaves, wood blocks, planks, etc.*

## Crafting

Place four [sticks](Stick "wikilink") in a 2x2 formation to craft. You
get one campfire. It can be made in the handcrafting interface. A
crafting table is not necessary.

## Uses

  - Warmth
  - Drying the character. 
  - Keeping (some) predators away
  - Lighting an area.
  - You cannot cook on a campfire

## Notes 

  - Campfires will NOT catch other things on fire. You can build one on
    top of burnable blocks and they will not ignite. So, you can place a
    dispenser right next to a campfire and have it automatically feed
    the fire. The dispenser will not catch fire.
  - There are 15 levels to a campfire (plus 1 for the bed of ash it
    leaves). The campfire you craft is at level 3. The campfire shows
    only 8 of these levels (plus the ash bed) as seen here:

  - Campfires will reduce by one level every 25 seconds (5 seconds if
    it's raining or snowing). 
  - Any item that can be used as a fuel in the
    [furnace](Furnace "wikilink") can be used to stoke the fire. You can
    drop fuel onto the fire or tap the fire while holding the fuel in
    your hand. Coal chunks are very effective to stoke the fire. 
  - Explosive objects will explode in the fire. 
  - A fully stoked fire will last 6 minutes 15 seconds (when dry) so it
    will not last an entire SC night without attention. But you can wake
    up through the night to restoke it.
  - You cannot sleep in the open, even next to a campfire. If you build
    one in a shelter, it can keep you warm but will not last an entire
    night.
  - Tap on the campfire while holding [snowball](snowball "wikilink"),
    [snow](Snow "wikilink") or [ice](Ice "wikilink") to put it out.
    Throwing [snowballs](Snowball "wikilink") will not work.
      - However, since snow (block) cannot be legitimately obtained in
        [Cruel](Cruel_Gamemode "wikilink"), [Challenging](Challenging_Gamemode "wikilink")
        or [Harmless](Harmless_Gamemode "wikilink"), you can only use
        snowballs or a [water bucket](Water_Bucket "wikilink") to put it
        out on those game modes.
  - Stepping on a fire will hurt you and eventually cause you to catch
    on fire. Standing too close to one will overheat the character and
    may cause him to faint.
  - It is usually possible to run around getting leaves fast enough to
    keep a fire going in a forest as long as it is not raining or
    snowing.
