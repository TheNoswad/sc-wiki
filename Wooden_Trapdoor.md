## <span style="font-size:20px;">Description (From </span>[Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink")<span style="font-size:20px;">)</span>

*Trapdoors are used to make vertical entrances to buildings. They can be
opened and closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire,
trapdoors will open or close on the rising edge of electric signal. Iron
trapdoors cannot be operated manually when electrically connected. They
can be placed normally or upside=down, depending whether they are
attached to top or bottom side of the block. Upside=down trapdoors will
stop falling blocks.*

## Crafting

Requires 6 [planks](planks "wikilink"). This will yield 2 trapdoors.

  - They are air blockers whether open or closed. They will stop heat
    loss even if left open.
