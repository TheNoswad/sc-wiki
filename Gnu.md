## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large antelope. Not normally aggressive but can defend itself if
attacked. Delicious to eat."*

## Description

The Gnu (wildebeest) is a mammal in Survivalcraft with a black muzzle,
brown fur, and horns similar to those of an impala but have a thicker
body. 

Gnus are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Red
flowers](Red_Flower "wikilink"), [purple
flowers](Purple_Flower "wikilink"), [white
flowers](White_Flower "wikilink"), [tall grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink"),
and [ivy](Ivy "wikilink").

They are non-hostile\*\*, and drop 1-2 [raw meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink")
when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Gnus are primarily found in Jungles/Forests.

## **Uses**

They are a meat animal. 

Gnu can be spawned in [creative gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink")
using a [spawner egg](Creative_Eggs "wikilink").

\*\*This animal is GENERALLY passive, but there is approximately a 92.8%
chance it will retaliate when attacked.
