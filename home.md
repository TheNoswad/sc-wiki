### **The  wiki  for  everything  SURVIVALCRAFT**

SurvivalCraft is a block terrain game where you are marooned on a
deserted island and must survive on your own. Every minute is a life or
death challenge. The terrain is infinite, so there is no escape. You
must learn to survive for as long as you can. You'll have to find food,
make your own clothing and build a safe shelter; all while avoiding
being eaten by lions, tigers or bears, and so much more\!

**Survival Craft** has 5 main [play modes](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Game_modes.md "wikilink"):

  - [**Harmless**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Harmless_Gamemode.md "wikilink")
  	- You don't have to
    eat or sleep, fall damage is reduced and the animals won't attack
    unless you hit them first. Otherwise, it is essentially the same as
  - [**Challenging**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Challenging_Gamemode.md "wikilink")
  	- You can die
    (easily) but can respawn (without your clothing or anything you were
    carrying). This is the most common game-play mode. All the
    challenges of survival are active but you get another chance when
    you die.
  - [**Cruel**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Cruel_Gamemode.md "wikilink")
  	- You only get one chance to
    stay alive. Once you die, the world is lost.
  - [**Adventure**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Adventure_Gamemode.md "wikilink")
  	- This is a world
    usually created by someone else and will usually have quests or
    missions. If you die, you must restart the world from the beginning,
    or may respawn if it's allowed. In adventure mode you cannot break
    block with your bare hands - you must have the proper tool. This can
    make it the most difficult mode of all.
  - [**Creative**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink")
  	-  You can fly, you
    don't have to dress, eat or sleep and you cannot be killed. Almost
    all blocks are freely available and easily broken.

> If you do manage to make a safe and secure shelter you can scout and
> mine for materials to craft weapons, tools and armor. Build a stronger
> shelter from stone blocks. Set simple or complex traps for the beasts.
> Grow your own crops. Domesticate horses, zebras or ostriches. Build a
> farm or a ranch and expand your territory.
>
> Just remember, one mistake and the tigers and wolves could ruin
> everything. It's not an easy life in SurvivalCraft - it's SURVIVAL\!
