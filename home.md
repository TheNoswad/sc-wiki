## About the Game

**Survivalcraft** is a block terrain game where you are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on your own. Every minute is a life or death challenge. The terrain is infinite, so there is no escape — you must learn to survive for as long as you can.

You'll need to find food, make your own clothing, and build a safe shelter, all while avoiding being eaten by lions, tigers, bears, and so much more! The rules of nature reign supreme: eat and avoid being eaten. If you're clever enough to make it through the first day, you still need a safe shelter for the dangerous night when predators hunt by your scent.

If you manage to build a secure shelter, you can scout and mine for materials to craft weapons, tools, and armor. Grow your own crops, domesticate horses and zebras, or build a farm and expand your territory. Just remember — one mistake and the tigers and wolves could ruin everything. It's not an easy life in Survivalcraft — it's about **SURVIVAL**!

## Game Modes

Survivalcraft features six distinct [game modes](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Game_modes.md):

- [**Harmless**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Harmless_Gamemode.md) — The easiest survival mode. No hunger or sleep required, reduced fall damage, faster health regeneration, and animals won't attack unless provoked.
- [**Survival**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Survival_Gamemode.md) — Normal survival mode. You can die but respawn at your last sleep position. Balanced difficulty with all survival mechanics active.
- [**Challenging**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Challenging_Gamemode.md) — Advanced survival mode. More frequent predators, harder temperature and hunger mechanics, and you cannot place blocks while in the air.
- [**Cruel**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Cruel_Gamemode.md) — Hardcore survival mode. Same as Challenging, but you only get **one life**. If you die, your world is lost forever.
- [**Adventure**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Adventure_Gamemode.md) — Quest mode perfect for custom creative maps. You cannot dig blocks without proper tools, and survival mechanics can be toggled off.
- [**Creative**](Recipaedia/Construction/Mechanics/Creative_Gamemode.md) — Sandbox mode. Fly freely, invincible, unlimited resources, and no survival requirements.
