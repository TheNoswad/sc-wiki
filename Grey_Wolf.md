## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A medium sized predatory animal that lives in cold and temperate
areas. Moves fast and hunts in packs at night. Will sometimes stop and
howl raising its head high to the moon. During the day is shy and will
move away from trouble. Extremely dangerous at night when encountered in
large numbers. Will smell prey from large distances and congregate to
hunt it. At full moon will change into Werewolf."*

## Description

Wolves are dog-like mammals in Survivalcraft with a charcoal gray back
and white underbelly.

They are carnivores, meaning they will eat:
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\].

Wolves are hostile, and a wolf will attack you in daytime if you seem to
threaten it. They hunt and live in packs so if you attack one, any other
nearby wolves will attack back \[as shown below\] also, if one wolf is
away from its pack it will go to the nearest pack and hunt and live with
them. They drop [Leatherwhen](Leather "wikilink") killed.
