## Description

Biomes are areas in the world that have differing plant life, animal
life, temperature, and humidity, regardless of the terrain they cover.
Some biomes are mainly associated with certain terrains however. For
instance deserts are rarely found in mountainous terrain. The ocean and
other water features will also have different biomes within them.

Other special terrain features are also included on this page.

Note: See [Terrain](Terrain "wikilink") for other details.

## Desert

The desert is the hottest and driest biome in Survivalcraft. There is no
vegetation or plant life except for [cacti](Recipaedia/Plants/Cactus.md "wikilink"). [dry
bushes](Recipaedia/Plants/Dry_Bush.md "wikilink") and [large dry
bushes](Recipaedia/Plants/Large_Dry_Bush.md "wikilink") are abundant. Very few animals are
present other then typical desert dwellers.

The terrain is usually fairly flat, but you can see some hills and small
mountains.

## Chaparral

The chaparral consists of dead coloured grass, and no plant life
\[except for dry bushes\]. [graves](Gravestone "wikilink") and
[Grasspits](Grasspits "wikilink") are commonly found in chaparrals. Not
very many animals present. In this biome generates Mimosa trees.

Terrain is usually slightly hilly.

## Temperate Forest

Temperate Forests are warm, semi-humid biomes. They consist of many
trees, usually birch and oak. A lot of plants and vegetation are
growing. Many animals are found here.

They range in terrain. They can be super flat or have high mountains.

## Tropical Forest

Tropical Forests are hot, humid biomes. They consist of many trees,
usually oak. This is the only biome in which ivy is present, found
hanging in the entrance of caves and on the foliage of trees. A lot of
plants are found here. Many animals are also found.

Tropical Forests are usually hilly.

## Tundra & Taiga (Snow Forest)

Tundra biomes are the coldest and least humid. Pools, ponds and lakes
usually freeze over. They are home to spruce trees and few animals. No
other vegetation grows here.

Taiga biomes are basically the above biome but including an abundance of
spruce trees and occasionally tall grass.

Cold-dwelling animals can be found in both Tundra biomes and Taiga
biomes, including [Tigers](Tiger "wikilink"), [Black
Bulls](Black_Bull "wikilink"), [Black Cows](Black_Cow "wikilink"),
[Wolves](Wolf "wikilink"), [Black Bears](Black_Bear "wikilink"), [Polar
Bears](Polar_Bear "wikilink"), the rare [White
Bull](White_Bull "wikilink") and the super-rare [White
Tiger](White_Tiger "wikilink").

Care must be taken when traveling across cold and snowy biomes, as the
player can literally freeze and die quickly of hypothermia. Surviving is
possible with a reliable heat source (Lava, fire) or fur clothing which
maintains body heat.

In either biome, terrain altitude ranges. Can be super flat or
mountainous.

## Other terrain features

Other terrain features that cannot be categorized as biomes.

### Ocean (Terrain)

The ocean consists of deep water, marine life and rare whales.
Temperature ranges. Clay, sand and dirt is abundant on the sea floor.

The ocean changes colour from royal blue (Cold temperature) to turquoise
(Warm, humid temperature) depending on the climate.

### Beaches/Shoreline (Terrain)

The shoreline can be hot or cool, depending on what biome you are in.
Sandy and gravel shorelines are found in Jungles/Forests, and icy
shorelines are found in Snowy biomes. Beaches can be either sand or
gravel.

Beaches are nearly always flat.

### Magma and Water Pools (Generated Structures)

Magma and water pools spawn randomly in caves. They can be dangerous
when mining as the player can either;

A) Drown

B) Fall in lava

C) Die of hyperthermia (See [Body
Temperature](Body_Temperature "wikilink"))

</div>

### Mountains (Terrain)

Mountains are usually spawned in Jungles made from dirt and granite, but
in or near Wastelands, you can find stone mountains as well. Coal ore is
plentiful on these mountains.

</div>

### Islands (Terrain)

Islands are found randomly throughout the ocean. The picture shows 2
different biomes on one island mountain. It's also an example of a
desert biome on a mountain.

</div>

### Floating Islands (Generated Structures or Terrain?)

Floating islands can be found randomly throughout your world. They are a
glitch, and simply float without any support.They are not uncommon and
are usually found in the desert.

Sand and gravel are both [Falling Blocks](Falling_Blocks "wikilink"),
but some floating islands made of either stay afloat even if the world
is in living mode, where gravel and sand fall if they are placed without
a supporting block underneath them.

</div>

## Foliage Colour

Foliage colour differs throughout different biomes. For example, a birch
tree planted in or near a desert will have reddish leaves and appear dry
whereas a birch tree planted in a forest or jungle will be lush and
green. The same applies to grass - both the grass block and growing or
dead grass plants. It also applies to [Christmas
trees](Christmas_tree "wikilink"), [Ivy](Recipaedia/Plants/Ivy.md "wikilink") and leaves.

<div style="overflow:hidden">

*A birch tree's foliage turns red when near a desert.*
