Clothing is a new Survivalcraft feature that was added in version
1.26.\[1\]\[2\] It is essential since version 1.26, as you cannot
survive the cold without it. When you first start a new world, you will
have tattered clothes, salmon socks and leather sandals. After a
respawn, however, you will only be wearing boxers.

## Description (from [Help](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Wearing clothing provides warmth in cold climates and armor protection
during combat. You can access clothing interface by using clothing
button.*

*There are 4 clothing slots on your body: Head, Torso, Legs and Feet.
Each slot can have multiple clothing items, layered one on top of each
other. The effects of multiple clothing items combine.*

*Not everything can be worn on top of anything else, for example you
will not be able to wear a T-shirt on top of a fur coat.*

*Wearing thick clothes in one slot while leaving another slot bare will
not afford much warmth. It's imperative to cover entire body to really
benefit from clothing. It's the thinnest piece of clothing that
determines how much heat you lose.*

## Crafting

Lightweight clothing is crafted from [cotton](Cotton "wikilink"). You
will have to grow cotton plants before you can craft these clothes.

Heavier clothes are made from [fur](fur "wikilink") and
[leather](leather "wikilink"). These materials are 'dropped' from
different animals when you kill them. See those pages to learn which
animals drop them.

[Armor](Armor "wikilink") can be made from [sticks](stick "wikilink")
and [string](string "wikilink"), or from [iron](Iron_Ingot "wikilink")
or [copper](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and may even be coated with
[diamond](Diamond "wikilink").

Each piece of clothing has its own page on this wiki as listed below.
See those pages for recipes for the different pieces of clothing. Also
see the [armor](armor "wikilink") page. 

NOTE: The old shirt, pants and hat are not craftable.

## Dyeing Clothes

To dye clothes, you take a paint [bucket](bucket "wikilink") of your
choice and put it and the desired piece of clothing, into a
[furnace](furnace "wikilink").

See the [painting](painting "wikilink") page to learn how to make paint
buckets.

See the [smelting](smelting "wikilink") page to learn about using the
furnace.

## <span style="font-size:20px;">Use</span>

To apply clothing, open the person interface with the body button on the
left of the screen. Then drag the clothing from your inventory and drop
it on the body image. If the piece is not put on, you are probably
wearing something in that slot already and have to take that off first. 

Clothing can help protect your your character from cold and attacks or
may simply for cosmetic reasons. 

### Layering Clothes 

Some types of clothing can be worn over others. Any insulation values
will add up in each slot. 

There are five layers in the body slot. You can wear a tank top/t-shirt,
a shirt, a leather jerkin/sweater, a chain mail and a fur coat. 

There are three layers in the legs slot. You can wear long johns/boxers,
pants and any leggings.

There are two layers in the feet slot. You can wear socks and some type
of footwear.

There is only one layer in the head slot.

## Notes

  - You can get a 6.49 insulation by wearing the following:

<!-- end list -->

  -

      -
        fur hat / t-shirt, shirt, sweater, fur coat / long johns, pants,
        fur leggings / socks, cavalry boots. Leather pants may be used
        in place of cotton pants. They have the same insulation value
        but better protection.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Getting wet](Body_Temperature "wikilink") affects your *body* and
    ALL clothes in your possesion. If you get wet, you cannot simply
    change clothes to get dry.

<!-- end list -->

  - Clothes will wear out over time. Getting clothes wet makes them wear
    out twice as fast.

<!-- end list -->

  - Remember that all clothing will be damaged when you are engaged in
    battle, or take a fall. Even cotton will provide a little protection
    from animal bites but will get damaged easily.

<!-- end list -->

  - Wearing heavy clothes and/or armor slows you down. However, diamond
    armor doesn't slow you down, and leather boots make you run faster.

<!-- end list -->

  - Wearing heavy clothes or armor will make you sink in water.
  - Should you get wet, dry your clothes off near a fire or build a
    quick campfire using 4 sticks.
  - Having clothes in your hand and attacking or mining will make them
    wear out **EXTREMELY** easily.
