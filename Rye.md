## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Plant Rye on tilled, moist and fertilized soil to obtain full grown
plants. Harvesting the plants will yield large number of rye seeds. Rye
also grows naturally in form or wild rye. You can obtain wild seeds by
harvesting it.*

## Growing Rye

Rye is the cultivated version of [Wild Rye](Wild_Rye "wikilink").
Properly planting and growing [wild rye
seeds](wild_rye_seeds "wikilink") will give you the cultivated rye
plants. The plants mature in [several stages](Rye_Stages "wikilink") and
you must wait until they are fully grown. You need the
[seeds](Rye_Seeds "wikilink") from harvesting the cultivated rye, to
make [flour](flour "wikilink") for your [bread](bread "wikilink").
