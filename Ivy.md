## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Ivy is a plant that grows and clings to vertical surfaces. It does not
require much light to stay alive, just a humid and warm climate.*

## Uses

Ivy is used to craft [string](string "wikilink") which is a useful
crafting ingredient.

Ivy blocks rain. The game sees ivy as a block so rain/snow will not fall
in that space. You can use this to line outdoor paths to keep you dry.

It is also useful as a decorative element and may be used in adventure
maps to disguise passageways or other items. These pictures show it
hanging over birch:

</div>

## Notes

  - Ivy only grows naturally in jungle biomes.

<!-- end list -->

  - It is easy to break without tools.
  - If you want to get the most when harvesting ivy, break it from the
    bottom up. Any piece below the one you break will disappear. 

<!-- end list -->

  - It is easy to propagate. Simply place it on any wall and it will
    quickly grow down the wall. After a time, it may also spread
    sideways.

<!-- end list -->

  - It can grow very long and will grow over doorways, fences, and just
    about anything else it is already above.

<!-- end list -->

  - It can make a very interesting decoration, for example a destroyed
    house which nature has noticed and has gotten to work on. It also
    looks like three green strings with leaves sticking out of it.

<!-- end list -->

  - Sometimes, in generated worlds, ivy can be free standing next to
    tree ivy, this is impossible to recreate and will break if anything
    is placed near it.

<!-- end list -->

  - Ivy is NOT climbable. You cannot stand on top of it.
  - Ivy is added in the 1.24 update.\[1\]
  - Ivy can be found naturally on oak trees.
  - It will not always grow beyond two blocks.
