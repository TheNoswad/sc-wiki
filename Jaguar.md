__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A medium-sized cat. Powerful, fast and able to jump very high. It is
almost impossible to run away from it once it starts the chase. Larger
and stronger than [Leopard](Leopard "wikilink"), but not as big as
[Tiger](Tiger "wikilink")*."

## Description

The jaguar is a medium-sized, dark furred big cat and has hard to see
spots. It is a carnivorous and relatively dangerous animal, although to
a lesser extent compared to other big cats, it is also a shy animal,
during the day it will flee from the player. It has the ability to jump
high.

Jaguars are carnivores, meaning they will eat:
[Bacon](Raw_Bacon "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\], and
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\].

Jaguars are hostile, but if you stay close to them they will attack.
When killed, they drop a piece of rotten meat with a 50% chance and a
piece of leather.

## Appearance Biome

Jaguars are generated mainly in the jungles. Sometimes they can be found
inside a cave.

## Notes

  - Because of its black coloring, jaguars are hardly visible in the
    dark of night and caves.
  - Jaguar can be spawned in [Creative
    Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") using a [Spawner
    Egg.](Creative_Eggs "wikilink")

## Trivia

  - Although the jaguar only has a black variant in game, jaguars can be
    both black and spotted in real life. They are often confused with
    leopards, which may also be black or golden spotted.
