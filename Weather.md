Weather was introduced in Survivalcraft in version 1.18. You can disable
weather in the [world options](world_Options "wikilink") in creative
mode. There are four types: Clear Skies, Snowfall, Rainfall, and
Thunderstorms.

## Clear Skies

</div>

This is the type of weather seen most in the Survivalcraft worlds. If
you have the options turned on in [World
Options](World_Options "wikilink"), you get to see beautiful skies,
fluffy clouds and colorful sunrises and sunsets. This is the time you
want to get out and do all the things that need to be done outside,
especially if you are in a temperate biome (not desert or snow).

## Snowfall

<div style="overflow:hidden">

![Snowfall.jpg](Snowfall.jpg "Snowfall.jpg")

</div>

Snowfall is precipitation occuring in cold biomes. Different shapes and
sizes of flakes can be seen. [Snow](Snow "wikilink") sticks to most flat
surfaces and you can harvest [snowballs](Snowball "wikilink") from it
later. Snow will *not* make you wet but it *will* make you cold. If you
are dressed properly, snow will cause you no harm.

Snow will not collect on partial blocks such as slabs placed on the
ground. Paths made from slabs will remain visible even in snowy climes.

It may snow at very high elevations, even if it isn't quite cold enough
at the lower elevations. This means a tall building may gather snow even
if it did not snow in that spot before.

## Rainfall

<div style="overflow:hidden">

</div>

Rainfall occurs in the temperate biomes: jungle, wasteland, forest, and
ocean. Rainfall makes it harder to see for great distances. It will make
you wet and you will get cold quicker. You should try to stay out of the
rain, or stay close to a desert so you can dry off when needed.

## Thunderstorm

<div style="overflow:hidden">

"Survivalcraft_2015-04-04_13-35-58-.jpg")

</div>

A thunderstorm can occur during any rainfall. A thunderstorm's rain also
makes seeing great distances difficult and also produces lightning that
can catch trees and buildings made of flammable blocks on
[fire](fire "wikilink"). Lightning can easily set the Player on fire and
kill you. It will break glass roofs without needing to set them on fire.

Lightning can destroy blocks with an explosion resilience of at least
20. Granite blocks and stronger materials are needed to avoid
destruction by lightning. Marble and weaker blocks may be destroyed. So,
lightning has an explosion damage of up to at least 20.

## Other weather effects

  - No precipitaion occurs in the desert due to the high heat. Instead
    it will just cloud the sky and reduce your view just like rain and
    snow. Lightning can even occur in the desert during a thunderstorm,
    so don't think you're too safe.
  - Your view will decrease during rain even if you are deep inside a
    cave. The cave will look blurry and the distances will look white.
    You can also hear the thunder from lightning. The temperature will
    also drop. So, if you're mining and thinking about going to the
    surface but the view starts to turn white, you know it's raining
    above and you might want to stay underground until it stops.
    Instead, use this opportunity to scout out the cave since it's
    actually easier to see at these times\!
  - Weather in SC worlds happens in the whole world at the same time.
    When it rains/snows, there is no place to go where it isn't - except
    the deserts.

## Notes

  - See [Clothing](Clothing "wikilink") and [Body
    Temperature](Body_Temperature "wikilink") for protection against
    being cold and wet.
  - Despite rainfall being[water](water "wikilink"), it doesn't
    extinguish [fires](Fire "wikilink") or break blocks.
  - Lightning can set off explosives if they are struck.
  - Weather does not affect the local humidity. Plants do not grow
    better when it rains. Animals are not affected by it.
  - ​Weather​ will break carpet, which was added in the 1.27 update
  - In 1.27, Lightning is explosive and it can be summoned in creative
    by the new lightning button (this is located in the top right
    corner). It does not have to be raining to summon lighting. It will
    NOT make explosions if the game is in static mode.
