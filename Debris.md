## Description

Debris are created when explosive material detonates around blocks. They
have a fire trail until they hit a surface. Some may turn into a
[dropped item](Dropped_Items "wikilink"), which you can then collect.

Debris can be dangerous , they can cause a little damage depending by
the block and will act as projectiles, may catch blocks on fire, and
break weaker blocks. They may be thrown up to 40 blocks from the
explosion.

[Incendiary Kegs](Incendiary_Kegs "wikilink") and
[Bombs](Incendiary_Bomb "wikilink") can make special red flaming debris.
Those red debris always set on fire flammable blocks.
