![Imagensjs.jpg](Imagensjs.jpg "Imagensjs.jpg") 1. **Clothes**-
[Clothes](Recipaedia/Clothes/Clothing.md "wikilink") are the most important thing to have
considering temperature is the quickest killing survival effect in the
game\! Always have a pair of clothes on and if you're on a long trip
bring an extra pair in case those wear out. Certain layers can be worn
in succession, for example cotton shirt/leather chest plate/fur coat, so
keep this in mind for seriously high warmth levels in the coldest
corners of the world

2\. **Machete and Pickaxe**- Although a machete and a pickaxe are very
different, they tie for second. A machete is very good if you get
involved with an aggressive animal or if you need food. A pickaxe is
nice to have if you see an ore sticking out of the ground, which could
save time later. ![Imagenednd.jpg](Imagenednd.jpg "Imagenednd.jpg") 3.
**Food (\>12)**- Food is something very important to have. Sometimes you
may find yourself hungry, but far away from home. Therefore if you have
food on you, then you can continue working.

4\. **Matches (40) and Coal Block (2)**- These are useful if you find
yourself in a Snow Biome, wet and freezing. If you place the coal block
down and light it, not only will it warm you, but it'll dry you very
fast. The reason to have a coal block and not wood is, wood destroys
when burnt, however coal blocks burns forever therefore you don't waste
anything.![Imagejhdn.jpg](Imagejhdn.jpg "Imagejhdn.jpg") 5. **Compass**-
A [compass](compass "wikilink") is useful for long trips. Compasses show
you the direction to your home at any distance\! As long as you have a
[magnet](magnet "wikilink") in your home and a compass in your pocket
you'll never lose your home again.

**<u>The "( )" is the advised amount to take.</u>**
