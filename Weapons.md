## Weapons

Weapons are extremely useful, but can also be very dangerous.  In order
to only cause damage you want caused, follow the caution statements at
the end of each weapon description.

Unless noted, striking or cutting weapons (and tools) are made from
wood, stone, copper or iron. You can add diamond to an iron edge to
improve it. This allows you to 'buff' a used weapon. Regardless how worn
the weapon is, you can restore it by coating the edge with diamond. It
will then have the same properties as a newly made weapon (or tool).

If a spear is thrown directly into the air above you, it may fall down
and hit you. Aim carefully when using it because spears can bounce off
some blocks and may hit you, severely injuring your character. 

**Fun Fact**: 

When thrown from a boat, spears can skip on water like rocks do in real
life\! This could have some practical applications like killing ducks on
a lake. From my (Trapmacer) testing, <s>it seems to only work when you
are in a boat.</s> From my (Anonymous493) testing, it works even without
using a boat.

[Gunpowder](Gunpowder "wikilink") and [Gunpowder

remain safe, be sure you are a very good distance away. (Because of the
pressure feature, It is almost impossible to get away from the blast
zone if you set a large Gunpowder Keg in a cave. It is much safer to
just use wires attached to a button.

## Thrown Items

There are several items that are not generally weapons but which can be
thrown for minimal (0.1) damage. These are often useful if you are
without any protection and being attacked. They may help put enough
distance between the animal and you but often prove to be a waste of
resources and barely injure or deter the animal.
