## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Wicker lamp is a torch placed inside a wooden and wicker shade. It
gives off slightly more light than the pure torch and is a nice,
decorative item.*

## Crafting

Use one [torch](torch "wikilink"), two [sticks](stick "wikilink") and
two [planks](planks "wikilink") to craft wicker lamp. You get one lamp.
