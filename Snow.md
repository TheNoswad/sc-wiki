## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*A form of frozen water, covers ground in cold biomes. During cold
weather, it may fall from the sky as snowfall and cover any area exposed
directly to the sky.*

## Notes

  - The snow block is only obtainable in creative mode and will melt if
    placed in a hot or moderate [biome](Biomes "wikilink").
  - When breaking snow, the player will obtain several
    [snowballs](snowball "wikilink"), which can be used for throwing.
  - It does not appear in the world as the full block as shown above.
    Instead it creates a thin layer on the existing
    [terrain](:Category:Terrain "wikilink").
