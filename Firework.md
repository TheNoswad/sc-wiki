__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__ Fireworks are new in version 1.28.

## Description

Fireworks are essentially a rocket with a delayed explosive. They are
launched vertically and can be crafted to form different shapes and
colors with the explosion. They may be launched by hand or out of a
[Dispenser](Dispenser "wikilink").![Fireworks\!](Fireworks!
"Fireworks!")

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Fireworks burst in the sky creating beautiful patterns. They can be
launched by hand, but it's better to launch them en masse using the
dispenser. And better still to wire multiple dispensers with electricity
and create a beautiful, programmed fireworks display. Fireworks come in
8 colors, 8 shapes, 2 altitude modes (low and high). Additionally each
firework can be made to flicker. Color and shape of the head determines
color and shape of the burst. Thick shafts burst high, narrow shafts
burst low. Red stabilizers indicate flickering.*

## Crafting

Fireworks are crafted using a variety of materials: [Sulfur
Chunk](Sulfur_Chunk "wikilink"), [Saltpeter
Chunk](Saltpeter_Chunk "wikilink"), [Canvas](Canvas "wikilink"),
[Gunpowder](Gunpowder "wikilink"), [Coal Chunk](Coal_Chunk "wikilink")
and a [Paint Bucket](Paint_Bucket "wikilink"). Will give you 20
fireworks and one [Bucket](Bucket "wikilink").

The arrangement of materials in the top row of the crafting interface
will determine the shape of the explosion.

The sparkle is controlled by the middle row of the crafting interface,
as well as the color of the burst. Replace the canvas with gunpowder to
make them sparkle. The color of paint used will set the color of the
burst.

The height of the explosion is set by the materials in the bottom row of
the crafting interface. Add more gunpowder to make them explode 'high'.

See 'appearance' below for more details.

## Appearance

There are four characteristics that you can set when crafting the
fireworks. All combinations of these characteristics are possible,
making a total of 256 varieties.

### Shapes (top row)

    <div style="overflow: hidden">
    ![Short_Trails_Shape.jpg](Short_Trails_Shape.jpg
    "Short_Trails_Shape.jpg")
    </div>

### Colors (middle row)

Use the paint bucket to set the colors:

1.  White
2.  Cyan
3.  Red
4.  Blue
5.  Yellow
6.  Green
7.  Orange
8.  Purple

### Sparkle (middle row)

Each variety can be flickering or steady.

  - Steady
    <div style="overflow: hidden">
    ![Steady_Stream.jpg](Steady_Stream.jpg "Steady_Stream.jpg")
    </div>
  - Flickering
    <div style="overflow: hidden">
    ![Flickering_Stream.jpg](Flickering_Stream.jpg
    "Flickering_Stream.jpg")
    </div>

### Height (bottom row)

Can be set to explode either high or low. The low variety will shoot for
about 1 second before exploding and the high variety will take about 2
seconds to explode.

  - Low
    <div style="overflow: hidden">
    ![Low_Rocket.jpg](Low_Rocket.jpg "Low_Rocket.jpg")
    </div>
  - High
    <div style="overflow: hidden">
    ![High_Rocket.jpg](High_Rocket.jpg "High_Rocket.jpg")
    </div>

## Notes

  - Can be thrown by hand
  - Can be launched from a Dispenser
  - They will not explode if launched horizontally
  - Can be crafted to create different shapes and colors
  - They are stackable up to 40 and are NOT flammable.
  - You can launch them from dispensers and set the timing of the
    launches with delay gates to create a longer lasting light show or
    have different explosions at varying times for a more complex show.
    The timing may even be controlled by a more advanced electric
    circuit to make them synchronized to some music.

## Trivia

  - In one of the first relases of version 1.28, there was Dark colored
    fireworks, but they were repleaced by Purple colored fireworks after
    an update
