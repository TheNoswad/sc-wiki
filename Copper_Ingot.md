## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*An ingot of pure copper. Can be crafted into copper tools, such as
buckets, wires, and other electric devices. Combine multiple ingots to
form a copper block.*

## Crafting

Copper ingot is made by smelting [malachite
chunks](Recipaedia/Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink") in a furnace. You can also obtain
them by dismantling solid [copper
blocks](Solid_Copper_Block "wikilink").

[Buckets](Bucket "wikilink"), [Solid Copper
Blocks](Solid_Copper_Block "wikilink"), [Batteries](Battery "wikilink"),
and other electrical items. As of 1.29 can be used to make amor, tools,
and weapons.

## Notes

  - Do not form them into blocks to hope to save storage space - the
    blocks only stack up to 4 blocks (36 ingots) whereas they can be
    stacked up to 40 in their original form
