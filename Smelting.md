![Furnace.png](Furnace.png "Furnace.png")This page covers smelting,
cooking and other uses of the furnace.

The furnace allows you to cook meat and make ore ingots, glass, etc. 

See the [furnacepage](furnace "wikilink") for more information about the
furnace.

## How to cook and smelt

![Furnace_UI_batch.png](Furnace_UI_batch.png
"Furnace_UI_batch.png")Open the furnace by tapping on it. A window will
pop up with the furnace interface on the left side and your inventory on
the right. There are three sections in the interface. The top section is
for the raw material. Most uses need only one box of the batch input.
The second box is for additional materials or when you need to use a
water bucket. The middle section is for the fuel and the bottom is where
the finished product is put. To exit the furnace interface, tap the
inventory or the body button on the left of your screen. See the User
Interface to learn more about all the buttons.

Most furnace uses need only one box of the batch input. This includes
all cooking of meats, baking [bread](bread "wikilink") from
[dough](dough "wikilink"), smelting of the ores, making
[glass](glass "wikilink") from [sand](sand "wikilink"),
[granite](granite "wikilink") from
[cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink"), [coal](Coal_Chunk "wikilink")
from wood ,[bricks](Brick "wikilink") from [clay](clay "wikilink") and
[white pigment](White_Pigment "wikilink") from
[limestone](limestone "wikilink"). 

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Furnace_UI_fuel.png](Furnace_UI_fuel.png "Furnace_UI_fuel.png")

</div>

Drag your fuel into the middle box, where the coal chunk is in the
picture.

Drag your raw material into one of the boxes in the batch section (top).
You can exit and leave the furnace and the materials will cook or smelt
on their own. They will be put into the bottom section as they are
finished and you can come back and pick them up later. If you put
something in the other batch box, it will stop the cooking process.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Furnace_UI_output.png](Furnace_UI_output.png
"Furnace_UI_output.png")

</div>

The three slots under the top section are a visual aide to show that the
fire is burning. The fire will keep burning until all the fuel is used
up or the materials are finished smelting.

NOTE: You can waste a lot of fuel if you only smelt or cook a few items
at a time\! Once the raw material is used up or removed, the fuel will
NOT keep burning until it is exhausted, as in other games. **One coal
chunk can smelt up to 11 ore chunks but if you only put one ore in the
materials box, the coal will only smelt that one and then go out\!\!\!**

### Cooking Eggs (batch use)

[Eggs](Eggs "wikilink") must be cooked using a [water
bucket](Water_Bucket "wikilink"). Each egg needs *one full bucket*  to
cook. However, it does NOT use up the water - it simply has to be there.
When each egg is cooked, it will be moved to the output box on the
bottom. One water bucket will also be moved with it, into the other
output box.

If you don't want to make a lot of buckets for cooking, you can do it
with only 2 or 3. Three buckets is a lot easier than two but the process
is the same. You'll have to keep the furnace open the entire cooking
time to use this method.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Cook_Egg1.png](Cook_Egg1.png "Cook_Egg1.png")

</div>

Place all the eggs in one batch input box. Make sure there is enough
fuel. Place your three buckets in the other batch box and the eggs will
start cooking.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Cook_Egg2.png](Cook_Egg2.png "Cook_Egg2.png")

</div>

As soon as one egg is done, it will be moved to the output along with
one bucket.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Cook_Egg3.png](Cook_Egg3.png "Cook_Egg3.png")

![Cook_Egg4.png](Cook_Egg4.png "Cook_Egg4.png")

</div>

You must then take that bucket and move it back into the batch box with
the rest of the buckets. You will have more time to move the buckets
when you use more than 2 at once. You must move them BEFORE the last
bucket is used from the batch box or it will start using up another coal
chunk.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Cook_Egg6.png](Cook_Egg6.png "Cook_Egg6.png")

</div>

Keep doing this until all the eggs are cooked.

### Other Batch uses

Some items are created in the furnace with two different materials.

To make [marble](marble "wikilink"), place
[limestone](limestone "wikilink") in one batch box and
[sand](sand "wikilink") in the other. They will smelt together to make
the marble in the output box.

All [colored paints](painting "wikilink") start off with a white paint
bucket. To make white paint, you need a [bucket of
water](Water_Bucket "wikilink") and one [white
pigment](White_Pigment "wikilink") for *each* bucket of paint. Place the
buckets in one batch box and the pigments in the other.

The same process is used to change the color of paint. Place the paint
bucket in one batch box and the colorant in the other batch box. See
[painting](painting "wikilink") for the recipes.

## Fuel For The Furnace

In order to smelt the above items, you will need to obtain fuel. The
following can be used as fuel, in decreasing order of their fuel value:

  - [Coal Blocks](Solid_Coal_Block "wikilink") (uses 9 coal chunks)  
    600 (Keep in mind that using 9 coal chunks give more energy than a
    solid coal block since 9x80=720)
  - [Coal Chunk](Coal_Chunk "wikilink") 80
  - [Solid Diamond Block](Solid_Diamond_Block "wikilink") 40 \*\*
  - [Oak Wood](Oak_Wood "wikilink") 20 \*
  - [Spruce Wood](Spruce_Wood "wikilink") 20 \*
  - [Birch Wood](Birch_Wood "wikilink") 20 \*
  - [Diamond](Diamond "wikilink") Crystals 20 \*\*
  - [Gunpowder](Gunpowder "wikilink") 10 (May Explode)
  - [Sulphur Chunk](Sulphur_Chunk "wikilink") 10
  - [Campfire](Campfire "wikilink") 10
  - [Wooden Planks](Planks "wikilink") (Painted Planks Included) 5 \*
  - [Wire Through Planks](Wire_Through_Planks "wikilink") 5
  - [Christmas Tree](Christmas_tree "wikilink") 5
  - [Cactus](Cactus "wikilink") 5
  - [Wooden Slab](Wooden_Slab "wikilink") (Painted Slabs Included) 5 \*
  - [Wooden Stairs](Wooden_Stairs "wikilink") (Painted Stairs Included)
    5
  - [Wooden Door](Wooden_Door "wikilink") 5 
  - [Wooden Trapdoor](Wooden_Trapdoor "wikilink") 5
  - [Ladder](Ladder "wikilink") 5
  - [Spiked Plank](Spiked_Plank "wikilink") 5
  - [Sign](Sign "wikilink") 5
  - [Wooden Fence](Wooden_Fence "wikilink") (Painted Fences Included) 5
  - [Wooden Fence Gate](Wooden_Fence_Gate "wikilink") (Painted Fence
    gates Included) 5
  - [Crafting Table](Crafting_Table "wikilink") 5
  - [Chest](Chest "wikilink") 5
  - [Dispenser](Dispenser "wikilink") 5
  - [Wicker Lamp](Wicker_Lamp "wikilink") 5
  - [Carpet](Carpet "wikilink") 5
  - [Large Dry Bush](Large_Dry_Bush "wikilink") 2
  - [Ivy](Ivy "wikilink") 1
  - All [Cotton](Cotton "wikilink") plants 1
  - [Cotton Wad](Cotton_Wad "wikilink") 1
  - [Dry Bush](Dry_Bush "wikilink") 1
  - [Oak Leaves](Oak_Leaves "wikilink") 1
  - [Spruce Leaves](Spruce_Leaves "wikilink") 1
  - [Birch Leaves](Birch_Leaves "wikilink") 1
  - [Tall Spruce Leaves](Tall_Spruce_Leaves "wikilink") 1
  - [String](Strings "wikilink") 1
  - [Feather](Feather "wikilink") 1
  - All [Clothing](Clothing "wikilink") 1
  - [Tall Grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink") 0.5
  - [Wild Rye](Wild_Rye "wikilink") 0.5
  - [Rye](Rye "wikilink") 0.5
  - All [Flowers](Red_Flower "wikilink") 0.5
  - All [saplings](Oak_Sapling "wikilink") 0.5
  - All [seeds](Rye_Seeds "wikilink") 0.1

\* If you need to burn wood as fuel, the most efficient way is to craft
them into slabs. Wooden planks give the same total fuel as wood blocks,
but you get 4 slabs from 3 planks. All other crafted wooden products end
up giving less total fuel, so they should only be burned to get rid of
them, or if you have no choice.

\*\* While Diamonds and Solid Diamond Blocks have tecnically a fuel
value (20 and 40), they can no longer be used as a fuel in the latest
updates.

## Notes

  - When you gather wood, you will also get a lot of leaves. Use these
    to cook or smelt small amounts of items to save coal and get rid of
    all the excess leaves. 
  - [Cacti](cactus "wikilink") will grow in any condition as long as
    it's on sand. This provides an infinitely renewable fuel source.
  - Any fuel that can be used for smelting can be used as a fuel for the
    [Campfire](Campfire "wikilink") too.
