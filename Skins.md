## Description

Skins are used to change the appearance of the character. This article
describes how to get and use skins but does not provide the skins or
links to them. 

## How  to get skins

Skins (and worlds and textures) can be downloaded completely free from
Community Content or from other sites including the [official
forum](http://survivalcraft.lefora.com). See the page on [Uploading and
Downloading](Uploading_and_Downloading "wikilink") first. This will
teach you how to use the built-in loader and how to direct download
files then import them into the game. 

### From Community Content 

When you are in the Community Content list screen, there is a drop-down
menu at the top-right, where you choose to see only skins. Scroll
through the files list until you find the skin you want to try and
select it. Then simply tap DOWNLOAD. It will be downloaded and
automatically imported into the game. 

### Copy link Download 

If you have the link copied into the clipboard, you can use this method
to download and automatically import the skin into the game. See the
[Uploading and Downloading](Uploading_and_Downloading "wikilink") page
for details. 

### Direct Download 

See the [Uploading and
Downloading](Uploading_and_Downloading "wikilink") page for details.
This method will NOT automatically import the skin into the game. You
will have to use the technique described on the [Uploading and
Downloading](Uploading_and_Downloading "wikilink") page to import them
into the game. 

### Backup the Skin

When you download ANY file from Community Content or use the Copy Link
method, the file is NOT backed up to the SD. This is because it is
already online and that IS the backup. However, you may wish to have it
backed up locally. Again, the [Uploading and
Downloading](Uploading_and_Downloading "wikilink") page will teach you
how to do that. 

## Applying the Skin 

After a skin or texture is downloaded and imported, it is available to
the game. Then you can use it in your worlds. 

To apply a skin to a world, you have to be in the CURRENT WORLDS screen.
This is the screen where you choose the world you want to play in. 

Select the world but don't tap PLAY. Instead, tap the (...) button. This
will bring up the OPTIONS screen. At the top of this screen are two
selection boxes. One is for the texture and the other for the skin. Tap
the skins box and a drop-down menu will show up. It may take a minute if
you have a lot of skins to pick from. Scroll through the list and select
the skin you want to use in this world. It can be changed at any time. 

Now back out to the CURRENT WORLDS screen and tap PLAY. The world will
now be using the skin you chose. 

## Making Skins 

You can make skins using many software. The easy software is ISO
Pix-Pixel art Editor. 

1.  Download **ISO Pix** and **ARC file manager** on android
2.  Download *256x256 defult png image* of skin.
3.  Open this image in **ISO pix**.
4.  Edit it
5.  Save it with **.png** format
6.  Rename the file with **.scskin** format using **ARC file manager**.
7.  Export it to **Survival craft** Folder
8.  Download it in to survival craft.

## Deleting Skins

You will want to delete skins, textures and worlds you no longer want in
the game. This will keep the game file from getting too big. Plus the
list can take a long time to build when there are many items. 

To delete this content, choose GET CONTENT from the main screen. Then
tap MANAGE and this will bring up the list of all content that was
imported into the game. Scroll down and select the skin you want to
remove and tap DELETE. You can continue to delete more content or back
out of this screen. 

## Notes 

[Armor](Recipaedia/Clothes/Armor.md "wikilink") and [Clothing](Recipaedia/Clothes/Clothing.md "wikilink") can be
placed on any skins; not just the default (as shown below).

## Skin Downloads

People can post custom skins here. We recommend also posting it to the
'official forum' here:
<https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/survivalcraft/survival-craft-skins-f41/>

You can post the file here. Then others can download it here so others
can see it before downloading.

Please only post the image in the gallery bellow, along with a short
description. Any additional comments should be added on the talk page.
And also, for jpg skins, save as png. Then, for every skin, rename it to
scskin. Thank you.
