__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__ This article is about the ship that
maroons you at the beginning of a world. For the one you can craft and
mount please see the article [Boat](Recipaedia/Items/Boats.md "wikilink").

When you first start a world, you are marooned by a ship on the shores
of your world. Then the ship will start to sail away, leaving the player
behind on the island. Beginning in V2.0, the sea level may be set
higher. If the sea level is high, you may be left in a boat. It is
possible to follow the ship by flying after it on creative when you
start a world. However, if you let it sail away from you, it will
eventually disappear.

The Player cannot ride on it and will just go right through the ship. It
is not harmed by explosives and cannot be blocked by placing blocks in
front of it. ![31.png](31.png "31.png") The current story behind why the
Ship marooned the Player on the island is unknown. However, there is
text in the intro of the game. Line 1 "Cast away, boys". Line 2 "Hey
you, on the shore/in the boat\!" Line 3 "We're leaving you here for
good\!". That is currently all there is.

## Notes

  - Sometimes the ship ends up going through islands if you follow it
    far out to sea.
  - It is impossible to touch the ship. You will go through it, as it is
    an intangible item. 
  - When the ship passes through an item, for example, an island or any
    placed blocks, it will sometimes appear black. However, the vessel
    will retain its usual form as it continues through the obstruction. 
  - The ship will sail forever in the same direction that it departs.

## History

  - The Ship is in all versions since 1.0
  - 2.0- The text for the intro of the game has changed
