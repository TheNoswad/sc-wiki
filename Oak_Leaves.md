## **Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )**

*Oak leaves grow on Oak trees and can be used to obtain Oak saplings.
They will burn and can be used as a cheap fuel. When placed away from
the trunk, they will decay. Grass traps that can deceive both man and
beast can be crafted from these leaves.*

## **Appearance Biome**

Oak [Trees ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Trees)are found in
Hot, Humid [Biomes](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Biomes)
\[Jungle\].

## **Uses**

Oak leaves can be used to make [Grass Traps](Grass_Trap "wikilink"). 

They can be used as fuel for
the [furnace](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Furnace) although
they are very inefficient. This is helpful early in the game. 

## Notes

  - You do not need tools to gather leaf blocks unless you are playing
    in adventure mode. 

<!-- end list -->

  - The recipaedia states that placed leaves will decay but that is not
    the case. They can even be used to make temporary or permanent
    shelters if protected from fire and lightnings.
  - Destroying leaves using a [Feather](Feather "wikilink") will cause
    it to break, but will not drop itself, making it useful for cleaning
    trees without the mess.
  - Leaves have a 15% chance of dropping a stick instead of a leaf
    block. (Confirmed by SteppenwolfMLP, 11/08/2021).
