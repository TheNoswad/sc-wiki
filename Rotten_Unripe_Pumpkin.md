## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Rotten pumpkin, do not eat.*

## Notes

Food rots when left alone for a period. Rotten food is dangerous to eat
as it can cause you to get [sick](Sickness "wikilink"). Rotten unripe
pumpkin are pumpkin blocks that have been found to be rotten. These
appear during the creation of pumpkin crops. The squash will first go
through its immature phase before reaching its mature stage. If ripe or
immature squash is not harvested after several days, it will spoil. They
cannot be used as food except boars, bears, ostriches and cassowaries
may eat it because it dropped or thrown on the ground or while trying to
break one loose.
