## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )

*A piece of sulphur on a stick, can be used to start fires. Be very
careful when walking with matches because it is very easy to
accidentally start a fire that may go out of control. Can be used to
ignite fuses and as a weapon to set other animals on fire.*

## Crafting

A match is made with one [stick](stick "wikilink") and one [chunk of
sulphur](Recipaedia/Minerals/Sulphur_Chunk.md "wikilink"). You get 4 matches.

## Notes 

  - Using a Match to burn an animal in any game mode different from
    creative, there is a small chance that the fire doesn't start.
  - Since version 1.29, animals will not necessarily burn to death when
    set afire - they may put the fire out and still chase you\!
  - Matches can be used to ignite [Gunpowder
    Kegs](Gunpowder_Kegs "wikilink"), [Incendiary
    Kegs](Incendiary_Kegs "wikilink") and [Electric
    Detonators](Electric_Detonator "wikilink") without using electric
    wires. Beware, is really risky to ignite an explosive with a match\!
  - You should only have a match in your hand when you are about to use
    one. Items such as doors and chests will not open. Instead the match
    will light them on fire\!
