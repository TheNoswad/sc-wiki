## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Pigment is the main constituent of paints. It can be obtained by firing
limestone in a furnace until it turns into white powder. To make white
paint, boil the pigment in water using the furnace.*

## Crafting

Use the [furnace](furnace "wikilink") to heat [limestone
blocks](limestone "wikilink"). You get 2 white pigments for each block.
