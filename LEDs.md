__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## **Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") )**

*A light emitting diode. When connected to a power source emits weak
colored light. The light is too weak to light up the surroundings, but
it's easily visible. It has inputs on all sides for easy connection and
can be placed on any horizontal or vertical surface.*

## Crafting

Crafting LEDs require 3 [copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink"), one
[glass](glass "wikilink") and one [bucket of
paint](Paint_Bucket "wikilink"). This device can only use the reduced
color set. See the [painting
page](Painting#Paintable_Blocks "wikilink"). You get 4 LEDs.

## Use

  - Simply run a wire from them to any power source or signal line. They
    can also be connected by a wire-through-block.
  - They are a 'digital' device, so they react to on/off signals.
  - They can be used to mark your paths or your house but without
    lighting up the surroundings.
