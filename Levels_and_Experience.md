Level and Experience is a new mechanic introduced with Survivalcraft
2.1, allows to your [Character](Character "wikilink") to become
stronger, faster, more resilient and improving other parameters by
acquiring [Experience Orbs](Experience_Orb "wikilink").

## Description (From Help)

*Your character becomes more experienced over time. Experience is
represented by little golden orbs that can picked up. They appear when
you mine minerals, harvest crops or hunt animals. Collect them.*

*If you gather enough experience, your character will advance to the
next level. Your strength, speed and resilience will increase and you
food needs will decrease. You will also be able to use more advanced
tools, weapons and armor.*

*When you die and respawn, your level is reduced to a much lower value.
It will take a lot of time to regain the lost experience.*

## Levelling Up

This table shows an estimation of how many orbs are needed to advance to
each level. The numbers are estimates only since many things affect how
fast you gain experience, including simply staying alive. The "Orbs
Needed" shows how many orbs it takes to get to the next level from the
previous one.

| Level | Orbs needed |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 2     | 84          |
| 3     | 90          |
| 4     | 97          |
| 5     | 105         |
| 6     | 112         |
| 7     | 123         |
| 8     | 131         |
| 9     | 143         |
| 10    | 153         |

## Improvements

Every time that you will level up, your stats (Strength, Resilience,
Speed and Hunger) will be improved, until you reach level 21. At level
21 your stats will reach a maximum cap, you can still gather experience
and level up, but none of your stats will be improved.
