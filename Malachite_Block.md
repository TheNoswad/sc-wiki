## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A block of malachite can be made by combining together many smaller
[malachite chunks](Recipaedia/Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink"). This material is very
decorative but also brittle.*

## Crafting

It requires 9 [malachite chunks](Recipaedia/Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink") to form 1
malachite block. ![10.png](10.png "10.png")

## Use

Malachite blocks will stack up to 40, unlike any other solid ore block.
This makes it an efficient way to store malachite chunks.  

Do not smelt them into [copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink") until
you are ready to use that copper.

They make an attractive decoration block but break very easily so they
must be protected from damage.

## Notes

  - It is the only ore block that stacks up to 40.
  - Malachite blocks can be broken back down to reclaim the [malachite
    chunks](Recipaedia/Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink").
