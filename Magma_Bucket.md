__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Bucket is a container made of copper and used to carry fluids, such as
[Water](Water_Bucket "wikilink"), magma or [Milk
Bucket](Milk_Bucket "wikilink"). A [Bucket](Bucket "wikilink") can be
filled with the fluid at a source block and transported to a different
location, where the source block can be placed to start a new body of
fluid. You cannot fill the bucket from a non-source block. *

## How to Obtain Magma

Magma is found deep under the ground with basalt and can be obtained
using a bucket.

Approach the magma with the bucket in your hand. Tap the body of magma.
It will fill the bucket with magma. 

You should immediately select a different item or move it to your
inventory because keeping the magma bucket in your hand can be very
dangerous.

## Notes

  - Magma bucket is stackable to 40, but ONLY in the inventory. You can
    only stack 1 in the hotbar.

<!-- end list -->

  - If you try to open a door or chest while holding the magma bucket,
    it will pour the bucket out instead and destroy the door or chest\! 

<!-- end list -->

  - Don't put it anywhere close to houses, trees, fences, animals, etc.
    It can spread several blocks in any given direction and will destroy
    (or ignite) any flammable items in its path.
