## Description Â  (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A piece of cooked bird meat. Very tasty and nutritious meal.*

## Crafting

It is made by cooking [raw bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") in a
[furnace](furnace "wikilink").

## Notes

  - It can also be made by setting the bird on fire with a
    [Match](Match "wikilink") or a [Fire Arrow.](Fire_Arrow "wikilink")
    This does not always work since the meat may also burn up in the
    fire.
