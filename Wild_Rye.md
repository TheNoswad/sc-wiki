__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Recipaedia))

*Plant rye on tilled, moist and fertilized soil to obtain full grown
plants. Harvesting the plants will yield large number of rye seeds. Rye
also grows naturally in form of wild rye. You can obtain wild seeds by
harvesting.*

## Uses

### Food

[Horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink"), [camels](Camel "wikilink"),
[donkeys](Donkey "wikilink"), cows, bulls, [gnus](Gnu "wikilink"),
[bison](Bison "wikilink"), [reindeer](reindeer "wikilink"), and
[zebras](Zebra "wikilink") will eat Wild Rye.

### Farming

Wild rye can be grown as a crop. If you plant any [rye
seeds](Recipaedia/Plants/Rye_Seeds.md "wikilink") in improper conditions, it will grow into
Wild Rye. To get cultivated [Rye](Recipaedia/Plants/Rye.md "wikilink") for making
[bread](bread "wikilink") , it must be planted carefully. See the
[Farming](Farming "wikilink") page. 

### Trapping

You can also throw wild rye on top of your grass traps to lure cows,
bulls, and gnus right into your trap.
