## Use

From wikipaedia: "Long underwear, also called long johns or thermal
underwear, is a style of two-piece underwear with long legs and long
sleeves that is normally worn during cold weather. It is commonly worn
by people under their clothes in cold countries."

They are used in place of boxers, in the game. They are needed to get
the maximum insulation rating, so you are less likely to freeze in cold
climates.
