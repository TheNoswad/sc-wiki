__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink")) 

*Sulfur Ore is a vein of elemental sulfur embedded in basalt rock. Gains
sulfur chunks when mined. Be careful, because certain ores require
special tools for successful mining of the mineral. If improper tools
are used, the mineral is lost. Sulfur can be used to make pyrotechnic
substances, like gunpowder or matches. *

## Use

Sulfur Ore is only obtainable in [Creative
mode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink").  When the block is broken, it drops
3 [Sulfur Chunks](Sulfur_Chunk "wikilink"), which are used in making
[gunpowder](gunpowder "wikilink"), [fire
arrows](fire_Arrows "wikilink") and [matches](match "wikilink"). 

## Notes

  - Sulfur is uncommon and can be found in the
    [basalt](basalt "wikilink") layer and in deep caves that reach this
    layer.
  - Sulfur ore can be successfully mined with your hand in all game
    modes except [Adventure mode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink").
