## Description    (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Gravestone marks a final resting place of past inhabitant of this
land.*

## Crafting

Gravestones are made from [cobblestone slabs](Recipaedia/Construction/Stone_Slab.md "wikilink") and
[granite](granite "wikilink")/[cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink")
blocks.

There are 8 types of gravestones and they require 3 to 7 slabs and 0 to
4 stone blocks. See [recipaedia](recipaedia "wikilink") in the game, for
the different designs.

## Notes

  - Their color depends on the block they are placed on. They appear
    darker and more browned on [Sand](Recipaedia/Terrain/Sand.md "wikilink") or
    [Sandstone](Recipaedia/Terrain/Sandstone.md "wikilink") blocks.
