__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A spear is a versatile weapon that can both be thrown and used for
melee attacks. When used, it will eventually lose its sharpness and
fail. Spears made from better materials will last longer and cause more
damage. Thrown spears will stick in soft materials. It may be hard to
remove a spear that embedded itself too hard.*

## Crafting

Use three [copper ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and two
[sticks](Stick "wikilink") to craft one copper spear.
