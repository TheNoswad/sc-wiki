## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipedia "wikilink"))

A block of [diamond](diamond "wikilink"). Extremely valuable, contains
multiple diamond crystals combined into one large block. Good for
decorative purposes. Be careful, because diamond is flammable and will
burn when touched by [magma](magma "wikilink") or set on fire by
lightning.

## Crafting

![Solid_Diamond_Block_craft.png](Solid_Diamond_Block_craft.png
"Solid_Diamond_Block_craft.png")

Combine 9 [diamonds](Recipaedia/Minerals/Diamond.md "wikilink") to form 1 solid diamond block.

The block may be later broken down to retrieve the 9 diamonds.

## Use

Diamond blocks are primarily used as decoration or building materials.
Their extreme strength provides ultimate protection where explosion
resistance is beneficial. However they must be protected from lightning
and fire.

## Notes

They are found in the CONSTRUCTION section of the recipaedia.

They only stack up to 4, so are not a very efficient means of storing
diamond at 36 crystals per stack.

Unlike the diamond ore, this block can be successfully mined with any
tool or by hand.
