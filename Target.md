## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A target can be used for shooting practice. It will signal a hit with
an analog electric signal. The voltage of the signal determines how
close to the center the hit occurred, from 0.8V at the outside of the
target to 1.5V at the center. Voltages below 0.8V indicate no hit has
been registered.*

## Crafting

Crafting requires 4 white [painted](Painting "wikilink")
[planks](planks "wikilink") and 1 black painted plank. You get 1 target.

## Uses

The electric shooting target allows players to practice shooting
arrows/bolts/bullets or other thrown projectiles. You can connect the
target to a lightbulb and if the lightbulb lights up, you will know you
hit the target. If you connect it to a more complex circuit, it can tell
you if you hit the bullseye.
