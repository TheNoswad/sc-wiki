## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink") 2.0)

*A thin wire made of copper, it conducts electricity very well. Used for
making electric circuits. Wire can be placed on any surface and
connections with all nearby wires will be created automatically. A wire
will connect between edges of diagonally adjacent blocls. allowing you
to make hidden connections.*

## Crafting

Wire is crafted from one [copper ingot](copper_Ingot "wikilink"). You
get 16 wires. ![Electric_Wire-0.png](Electric_Wire-0.png

  - Wires may be attached to blocks that are moved by pistons but they
    will pop when the piston is activated.
  - Wires cannot be attached to slabs, stairs or any other more
    specialized blocks. However, in version 2.0, they can be attached on
    the full sides of slabs and stairs.
  - You can only connect wires to fence gates when they are attached to
    a wall.
  - Wires now lay straight on all blocks except clay, dirt/soil/grass,
    sand and gravel.
  - You can sometimes lay wires on a glass block but it may pop when
    electrified.
  - You can still open a wooden door, trapdoor or gate while they are
    connected to wires. The other doors and gates will not open by hand
    when they are connected to a wire.

This picture shows one way to have a 'hidden' connection.
