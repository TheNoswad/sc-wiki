## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*An electric button. Used to momentarily set the state of an electric
circuit to 1. The duration of the pulse generated by a single button
click is about 1/10 of a second, after which time the outputs return to
0 state. A button can be triggered by a projectile striking it. It has
outputs on all sides for easy connection and can be placed on any
horizontal or vertical surface.*

## Crafting

It takes one [planks](planks "wikilink") and 3 [copper
ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink") to craft. You get 4 buttons.

## Uses

  - Buttons are'' ''useful for opening and closing doors or fence gates.
    Doors respond to the rising edge of a signal, not to the signal
    level<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>(so
    [switches](Switch "wikilink") are not so good for them).
  - They are typically used to pulse an input to an electric circuit.
  - There are 5 output ports on a button. The four sides and the back.
    They can be used separately so the circuits do not feed into each
    other.
  - They can be used to make [furniture
    buttons](Advanced_Furniture#Furniture_Switches_and_Furniture_Buttons "wikilink"),
    craft them with a furniture to make your custom buttons.
