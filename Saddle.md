## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Saddle makes it possible to ride [horses](horse "wikilink") and other
animals. A horse without a saddle will quickly dump the rider and run
away.*

## Crafting

It takes 5 [leather](leather "wikilink") and 2
[sticks](stick "wikilink") to craft a saddle.

## To Use

Have the saddle selected in your hotbar. Approach the rideable animal
and tap on it (If you're using a controller, press **RT**/**R2** while
looking at the horse, or **Left Mouse Button** if using a keyboard and a
mouse). The saddle will be placed on the animal. Now you can ride it.

## Notes

  - Animals will drop their saddles when killed.
  - Saddles may be rarely obtained from the
    [grave](Gravestone "wikilink") structures.
  - Saddles are used on horses, camels and donkeys. Other animals will
    not let you saddle them.
  - It would be wise to practice controlling a rideable animal in a safe
    area before trying to ride one when in danger.
  - Saddles on animals will not change looks unless on a camel, then it
    will look more like a saddle pad.
