## Notes

  - They can be used for decoration, or as fuel in a furnace. However,
    they provide little fuel.
  - They will emit light when electrified.
  - You must use spruce leaves to make a Christmas tree; oak, tall
    spruce or birch leaves will not work.
  - Only the bottom block is solid. When you stand on the tree, you are
    only one block high. 
  - Christmas Tree texture is a 3D model, so is not editable. 
      - However, the leaves can be edited by editing the Spruce Leaves
        while the star and the lights can be edited by editing the iron
        ingot/iron tools texture.
