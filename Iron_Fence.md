## Notes

  - The iron fence can be used to keep desired animals in-and predators
    out.

<!-- end list -->

  - They can be used as window covering. This lets you shoot arrows
    through them. Just remember that animals can poke their head through
    fences and bite you if you are too close.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Camels](Camel "wikilink"), [Donkeys](Donkey "wikilink"),
    [Werewolves](Werewolf "wikilink") and [Tigers](Tiger "wikilink") can
    jump fences, so double fences are required.
