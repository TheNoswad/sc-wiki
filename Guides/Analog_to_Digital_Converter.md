<span style="font-size:14px;">Converts a single 4-bit analog signal into
the 4 digital bits that the signal represents.</span>

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Electric ADC. Converts one analog signal fed to its back to 4 digital
signals output through its sides. You need to place ADC on a
WireThroughBlock element to be able provide the input signal. Can be
placed on any surface and rotated to desited orientation.*

## Crafting

Requires 4 [copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink") and 3 [germanium
crystals](germanium_Crystals "wikilink") to craft ADCs.

You get 4 ADC chips.

## Hooking it up

You must place the ADC on a [wire through
block](Wire_Through_Planks "wikilink") and feed the analog signal
through that block. The 4 digital bits are output from the sides of the
chip and are wired normally. The least significant bit is marked by 1
dot, etc.

## Using it

An analog signal is often used to transmit up to 4 digital bit signals
on a single wire. Use the ADC to get the original 4 digital bits back.

The ADC are commonly used in combination with a
[DAC](Digital_to_Analog_Converter "wikilink"), [memory
bank](Memory_Bank "wikilink"), [RTC](Real_Time_Clock "wikilink") or
other device that outputs an analog signal.
