__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description

This is probably the most basic lock in the game. It's easy to build
(and understand) and it does not take too much space, so it's ideal for
locking your home even in challenging mode. Unfortunately, it's  very
easy to unlock, even if you dont know password (for better locking your
secret rooms, try [this](Advanced_button_lock "wikilink") ).

As you can see, code is 1-0-1-1-0 . Door will get open only if the
entered code is exactly the same. If you will (for example) enter
1-1-1-1-0, door won't open.

*NOTE: On the picture it's big, because I wanted to make it
understandable, so I put all the parts on one big wall. Normaly it
should be build in cube, with less spaces between the wires and logical
gates.*
