## **Description**

*NOTE: These pages are here just to show you that SurvivalCraft has more
possibilities than just building a blocky village. Although normal
people won't ever need these circuits, some "fans" may like them. I hope
I'm not the one and only.* - JustPlaying

Because these circuits are very complicated, we've decided to make a
separate page about each of them. Just click on the logo of the circuit
you want to observe.

Every normal calculator uses binary operations, but you don't have to
insert (and recieve) numbers in binary. It's because it has a binary to
decimal (and decimal to binary) conversion circuit. You can find out how
to build this special circuit by clicking the logo with *bin-\>dec* on
it.
