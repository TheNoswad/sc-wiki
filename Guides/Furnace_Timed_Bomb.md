The bomb is designed for those who don't want to waste iron and those
who can't. If you want a cheaper mining method, and you don't want to
lose all your treasure from your mine after the explosion, you're in the
right place\!

WARNING:Do not put the bomb near your shelter\!

This page doesn't include any images yet, please add a picture related
to this bomb if you can.

## Step one: Resources

You need at least:

As many as you like [cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink") (You won't use
any other ingredient,this is the cheapest, put in as much as you want to
destroy but \>7)

An item of [gunpowder](gunpowder "wikilink") or a small, medium or large
[gunpowder keg](../Recipaedia/Items/Gunpowder_Kegs.md "wikilink") (depends on the size of the
explosion you want)

A [furnace](furnace "wikilink")

A shelter in which you can survive the explosion

Anything that only requires 1 "Smelting Slot"

## Step Two: Set The Bomb

You have prepared all the stuff. Let's do this\!

First, you put a furnace on anywhere you want to set the bomb. Then, put
the cobblestone in the upper slot.

After that, you put the smelting item in it and it will start smelting.
Then you put the explosive charge in the fuel slot IMMEDIATELY, AND RUN
INTO YOUR SHELTER YOU HAVE BUILT\!

You may do anything in the shelter, in order not to waste time waiting.

## Step Three: Collect The Loot

After you heard the sound of the explosion, you go back to the place you
detonated the bomb, then gather everything, and see anything surprising
like you found another cave\!
