## **Description**

This circuit basicaly does an explosion WITHOUT an explosion - it
destoys just one wall and it does not use gunpowder keg, match, or
detonator. It was discovered by mgblitz81 (level-pro SC's electrician).
If you wonder how is it possible, [download the world
file](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/2ply3v4r5f9ja07/tde%20tutorial.scworld?dl=1),
or look at [official
topic](http://survivalcraft.lefora.com/2013/05/29/trap-door-explosion-trick/).

To make it you just need some trapdoors, delay gate,
[sand](sand "wikilink") or [gravel](gravel "wikilink") and several
[wires](../Recipaedia/Electrics/Electric_Wire.md "wikilink") connected to a
[button](button "wikilink") . Now make something that looks similar to
the picture (step 1 and 2)

When you will press the button (you cannot see it on the picture, but
it's connected with the wire leading to the bottom side), trapdoors will
open and (after 0.25 sec) close. The gravel wall will be destroyed. NOTE
- there are just two blocks of gravel , but normaly there should be how
many you want.

## **Usable in -**

This circuit comes very handy when you need the wall to disappear, but
you don't want to use [gunpowder kegs](../Recipaedia/Items/Gunpowder_Kegs.md "wikilink")
(because they will destroy whole room).

As of V2.0, this is done easier with [pistons.](../Recipaedia/Electrics/Piston.md "wikilink")
