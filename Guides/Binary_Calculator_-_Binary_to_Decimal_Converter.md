## **Description**

*[Back to Binary Calculator - Main Page](Binary_Calculator "wikilink")*

This circuit is probably the most complicated circuit in our calculator.
This circuit (as you can guess from its name) can covert a binary number
to decimal.

This circuit works with binary (like others) and can't be connected into
series to add bits into the final circuit (like the multiplier).

This circuit was created for demonstration purposes only, so it has only
4 bits and the max number you can get is 9 (1001bin -\> 9dec). Although
the circuit has just 4 bits, it has complicated scheme -

**A - D** are inputs for binary number, **0 - 9** are ouputs (showing
number in decimal)

You can also test it youself - [Binary Calculator world

## **Tutorial for our world**

The coverter is in front of you and it's labeled, so it won't be problem
to find it.

If you want to use it, don't forget these things -

1.  Our converter has just 4 bits, so the max number you can convert is
    1001bin (=9dec)
2.  It converts in real time, so please don't let the diodes interrupt
    you. You should look at them after finishing writing the number.
