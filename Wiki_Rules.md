-----

As many of you already know, many of the pages that appear on this Wiki
have recently been re-done, and the categories have been re-organized.
In order to keep this Wiki going as smoothly as possible, there are some
rules and regulations that everyone needs to follow. This will keep this
Wiki organized and a positive environment. So we thank everyone who is
taking the time to read this before you contribute.

-----

**Please note that any edit may be undone or changed and any page may be
deleted or rewritten by the administrators.**

-----

All general wiki rules apply to this particular wiki as well. Primarily,
you must not upload copyrighted information. If you do not follow these
rules, you may be banned from editing on this wiki.

**RULES:**

-----

No cursing or vulgar language in comments, pages, user's pages, etc.
Offensive, insulting or abusive language will NOT be tolerated. Please
report any inappropriate behavior to an administrator.

-----

Using substitutes for curse words is also vulgar and will not be
tolerated. You cannot use " \*\*\* ", or "S&^%&" as substitutes for
vulgar words either.

-----

1.  When creating a new page, please respect general visual organisation
    of other already present pages, which includes the use of generic
    titles as "Description" etc. Always use the Preview option before
    publishing to be sure everything's in order.
2.  Before creating a new page, please be sure to check and make sure
    there is not already a page on that particular subject and get
    permission from [Chart](Message_Wall:ChartreuseNarwhal "wikilink"),
    [Stanimus](Message_Wall:Stanimus "wikilink"), [Plant
    Champ](Message_Wall:Plant_Champion "wikilink")\*, or
    [Aylin](Message_Wall:Aylinerik "wikilink"),
    [Colby](Message_Wall:Colbyadamfranknorth "wikilink")
3.  When creating a new page, please don't forget to add the categories
    it belongs to. This helps users find similar pages.
4.  When editing a page, please don't forget to fill the Edit Summary
    field at the top right corner of the edit page. It permits other
    contributors to understand your edit and why you've done it.
5.  Do not remove any pages content without admin permission or a valid
    reason. ( A valid reason being incorrect info., outdated material,
    etc. ) If you are unsure about removing content, contact an admin.
    Better to be safe than sorry.
6.  Try to avoid grammar and misspelling errors. This goes for the Wiki
    pages and the Chat as well. It can make pages and comments confusing
    and hard for other users to follow.
7.  Spam will NOT be tolerated. Please note that Minecraft pics, useless
    info, useless comments, etc. all count as spam.
8.  Do not create *any* new categories without admin permission. This
    will help to eliminate chaos and confusion when trying to find
    similar pages. As you begin to type a category in the box, a list
    will pop up showing the known categories. If the one you want is not
    on this list, DO NOT enter it - notify an admin and they will decide
    if it's appropriate. \[See below for a list of categories you may
    use.\]
9.  Do not modify another user's profile page. This is considered severe
    vandalism and is cause for immediate disciplinary action. You will
    be banned for hacking someone else's profile. You may add to their
    message board or respond to a blog post, but never change their
    profile. If you see something offensive on it, please notify an
    administrator.
10. The forum is to be kept organized.
    See [THIS](Thread:21916 "wikilink") article if you have not
    already. Any failures to comply will be warned/blocked.  
11. Please do not use any pages' comments section to ask for "wanted
    features". This will be considered spam and may get you
    warned/banned. The comments section is intended for questions about
    the page or additional info we may have missed. The best place to
    post your wants is on the [official
    forum](http://survivalcraft.lefora.com/forums/1377297/Feature-Requests),
    or add to the [local forum](Special:Forums "wikilink"). This wiki is
    NOT run by the game designer. We cannot make changes to the game. If
    you truly want something in the game changed, see [Kaalus'
    blog.](http://kaalus.wordpress.com/)
12. Avoid addressing other users personally on any article page. The
    wiki is for information suitable for ALL users. Any personal attack,
    insult or intimidation, etc. is grounds for an immediate block
    without warning. 
13. Each active user may be held responsible for the comments on their
    own message board, even comments left by other users. If you don't
    want to allow more comments, you can close the thread with the
    drop-down menu under MORE. 
14. Any discriminatory behaviour, racial or religious insult will get
    you immediately blocked. Any other insult addressed to a single user
    or group of people is also not tolerated.

When adding infoboxes, please follow [those
guidelines](Special:User_blog:Stanimus/infobox_copy "wikilink") as well.

When filling in the infoboxes, see the documentation for that particular
type. There is a link at the bottom of each infobox that links to this
documentation.

\* Note: These users are not admins, but can decide if the page you
propose belongs as an actual page, blog post, forum post, etc.

included under that category ONLY. If you believe a page should be
