## Description (From [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A man is strong, can hit hard and withstand many injuries, but he is
slower moving than a woman and needs more food to survive."*

*"A woman moves fast and does not need much food, but she is weaker than
a man and cannot survive as many injuries."*

## Description

Yes, that's your character\! You, the human player, control the
character in the game. The character may also be abbreviated with 'PC'
which means Player's Character. Computer controlled characters are
called NPCs, for Non Player Character. This conforms with standard
naming in all modern games.

The character by default wears used and tattered clothing: [Old
Pants](Old_Pants "wikilink"), [Old Shirt](Old_Shirt "wikilink"), [Old
Tank Top](Old_Tank_Top "wikilink"), [Old Hat](Old_Hat "wikilink"),
[Socks](Socks "wikilink") and [Leather
Sandals](Leather_Sandals "wikilink").

The character is an omnivore, meaning you can eat:
[Meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Bird](Raw_Bird "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") \[raw or cooked\],
[Pumpkin](Pumpkin "wikilink"), [Sea Urchin](Sea_Urchin "wikilink"),
[Bread](Bread "wikilink"), [Eggs](Eggs "wikilink"),
[Milk](Milk "wikilink") and [Pumpkin Soup](Pumpkin_Soup "wikilink").

When killed, the character will drop any and all items it holds and all
clothing it is wearing except for boxer shorts, for modesty.

There are 8 players, 4 males and 4 females, all players have default
names:

Male Players:

  - Walter (the player before 2.1)
  - Basil (the one that has brown beard)
  - Geoffrey (the one that has no beard)

## Appearance Biome

The character appears on the shoreline when [The
Ship](The_Ship "wikilink") leaves you stranded and it tells you, "We're
leaving you here for good."

## Choosing a Skin

Each of the default skins have a different set of starting clothes,
which vary in color, and may help depending on spawn. Walter spawns with
good clothes for any area, having a hat, 2 layers of body clothing,
pants, and socks and sandals. Basil has a leather jerkin, which can be
very helpful, along with long johns. On the other hand, he has no hat,
so Basil is better for jungle areas, or warmer areas to start off with,
but if able to quickly make a hat, he is also great for cold biomes, due
to his long johns. Geoffrey and Zachary wear almost the same outfit, the
only practical difference being Zachary starts of with a cowboy hat,
which gives more protection and insulation. They are better off in
warmer areas, but Zachary could survive in a slightly colder area..
Mabel, with her small amount of clothing, is perfect for jungles, as she
spawns with cavalry boots, she can find some horses and get a quick
steed immediately.

    Gamemode.](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink")
  - Did you know that the before giving Character names in 2.1, the only
    character was referred as Walter by Kaalus, that is also his current
    name.\[1\]
