## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Rakes are tools for turning dirt into soil. After the soil has been
created by a rake, it is ready to be planted. The rake will eventually
get damaged and fail. Rakes made of better materials last longer.*

## Crafting

It requires 2 [Planks](Planks "wikilink") and 2
[Sticks](stick "wikilink") to craft one Wooden Rake.

## Use

A rake is used to prepare ground for planting. Approach the block that
you want to plant in. When holding the rake in your hand, tap the block
you want to prepare.

## Notes

  - The rake is one of the items that are not recommended to hold in
    your hand except when you are using it. Interactive blocks will not
    work properly if you are holding a rake. Instead of opening a chest,
    for instance you will 'rake' the chest.
