## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Tall grass randomly grows on well lit and humid grass blocks. You can
obtain grass seeds from it, which can be used to plant more grass. Can
be used as a decorative plant.*

## Food

[Horses](Bestiary/Horse.md "wikilink"), [Camels](Camel "wikilink"),
[Donkeys](Donkey "wikilink"), Cows, Bulls, [Gnus](Gnu "wikilink"),
[Rhinos](Rhino "wikilink"), [Wild Boars](Wildboar "wikilink"),
[Reindeer](Reindeer "wikilink"), [Zebras](Zebra "wikilink"),
and [Bison](Bison "wikilink") will eat tall grass.

## Animal Herding

Any herbivore will go after tall grass or flowers when dropped. Use this
as luring out tactic to hunt and gather animals for domestic use.

## Sneaking

Because there are so many dangerous animals lurking around, you may need
a place to hide from time to time. When you go into sneak mode, you are
able to hide behind anything with a minimum of one block tall. This
includes tall grass blocks. They are also great to hide behind while
shooting birds. They will not be able to see you, so they are less
likely to get scared and fly off. 

## Trapping

Line your spike pit traps with these to further trick the creatures that
wander by.(Needs verification...)

You can also throw tall grass on top of your grass traps to lure cows,
bulls, and gnus right into your trap.
