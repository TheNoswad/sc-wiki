## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

Starfish are underwater predators that move slowly across the sea
bottom.

## Notes

  - Although starfish are technically an animal, the game treats them
    more like a plant and they are even classified as a plant in the
    recipaedia. They are even harvested like a plant, using the axe.
  - You can 'collect' starfish like most blocks or plants. You do not
    'kill' them and they do not 'drop' items.
