## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A very rare albino mutation of a large grass-eating mammal. Not
normally aggressive but does not like anyone who approaches too close.
Dangerous when enraged. Delicious to eat. Provides more meat than
regular cattle."*

## Description

The White Bull is a mammal in Survivalcraft with a white pelt and horns.

Bulls are herbivores, meaning they will eat: [Purple
flowers](Purple_Flower "wikilink"), [red
flowers](Red_Flower "wikilink"), [white
flowers](White_Flower "wikilink"), [tall grass](Tall_Grass "wikilink"),
andÂ [ivy](Ivy "wikilink").

They are semi-hostile, but do not protect cows like brown and black
bulls, unusually they protect rhinos if the player hurts one but if the
white bull is hurt rhinos won't protect the white bull. They drop
between 6 to 8 [raw meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink") when killed.

## Appearance Biome

White Bulls are found in cold, snowy biomes.

## Uses

Bulls can be herded into fences using a whistle and can be killed for
food.

White Bulls are rare and there is no [spawner egg
in](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") [creative
gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"). White Bull Spawner is encoded
as 1572982. Therefore, you can replace the egg in hand with this value
by [editing the Project file](Hacking_The_Project_File "wikilink").
