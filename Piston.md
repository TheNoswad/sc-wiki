__NOEDITSECTION__

Pistons were introduced in V2.0

## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Pistons can be used to push and pull blocks. The extention of piston is
controlled by voltage applied to it. 0.8 v will extend piston 1 block,
0.9 v two, etc.1.5V will extend a piston a maximum of 8 blocks. Pistons
can also be edited to limit the maximum extention to lower values. If
the piston is a pull piston it will also pull one block back when
retracting. If the piston is a strick pull piston, it will not pull back
unless it is pulling back a block.*

This is the standard piston which does not pull blocks back with it.

## Crafting

It takes 1 [Copper Ingot](Copper_Ingot "wikilink"), 3
[Planks](Planks "wikilink") and 5 [Semiconductor
Blocks](Semiconductor_Block "wikilink") to craft 5 pistons.

## Use

Place the piston where you want it. It is a directional block like the
[Dispenser](Dispenser "wikilink") and will be aimed at you when you
place it.

It must be connected to an electric circuit to work. Even if the circuit
is just a switch. You should NOT try to connect to the top of it or it
may not work properly. Any connection must be to the bottom or sides.

  - The voltage applied to the piston controls how far it is extended.
    However, when the maximum distance is less than 8 (see below), it
    will not travel any farther than set.

### Editing it

Open its UI by making it center in the screen when you are close enough.
The sneak button will turn into the edit icon (sheet paper). Tap that
icon. The following window opens up:

<div style="overflow:hidden">

![Piston_UI.jpg](Piston_UI.jpg "Piston_UI.jpg")

</div>

From this window you can adjust the piston's speed and maximum distance.

## Moveable Items Lists

  - Almost every solid block can be moved with a piston - except
    [diamond blocks.](Solid_Diamond_Block "wikilink")
  - Note that some items can be moved by pistons when they are attached
    to the piston or the front of a moving block, but not if they are in
    the way of it.
  - All items which must be mounted to another block react differently
    depending on where they are attached. If they are attached to the
    side of a moving block, they will always pop off. If they are
    attached to a stationary block but in the path of the piston, they
    will *generally* stop it. If they are attached to the piston, or to
    the front of a moving block, they *generally* will be moved by the
    piston. Wires however, will pop in all three cases.

<!-- end list -->

  -   - Although signs can be pushed by pistons, as soon as they are
        moved, the sign is erased.
      - All programmed electric chips will be erased if they are popped
        by the piston movements.

<!-- end list -->

  - These items CAN be moved by pistons (they are piston-abled):
