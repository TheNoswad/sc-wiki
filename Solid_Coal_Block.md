__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A block of coal. If set on fire in the open, it will burn for a very
long time. Good as a long lasting fuel in the furnace. You can craft it
from a number of coal chunks, or split it back into them. Blocks of coal
can sometimes be found underground inside of rich coal seams.*

## Crafting

Combine 9 [coal chunks](Recipaedia/Minerals/Coal_Chunk.md "wikilink") to form 1 Solid Coal
Block. They may also be found naturally in heavy coal veins. 

The block may be later broken down to reclaim the chunks.

## Notes

  - Solid Coal Blocks are typically used as a decoration and are one of
    the darkest blocks in the game. They are nearly identical to Black
    Painted Basalt in the default textures. Remember they are
    flammable\!

<!-- end list -->

  - Coal Blocks *may* be used in a furnace as a fuel. Their fuel value
    is only 600 and 9 pieces of coal have a total fuel value of 720.
    Using one in a furnace wastes 120 fuel values.
  - They can be set afire in an open space and will burn forever.    
  - They only stack up to 4, so are not a very efficient means of
    storing coal at 36 chunks per stack. When you find one you should
    immediately break it down into chunks.
  - Solid Coal Blocks may be found by digging up new graves.
  - Solid Coal Blocks are good campfire makers. Remember not to set it
    on fire near flammable materials\!
