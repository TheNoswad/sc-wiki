In Survivalcraft, some animals can be herded using a horse and whistle.

## Which Animals can be Herded?

The following animals can be herded\*, as they will run from the
[whistle](whistle "wikilink") sound:

  - [Black Cow](Black_Cow "wikilink")
  - [Black Bull](Black_Bull "wikilink")
  - [Brown Cow](Brown_Cow "wikilink")
  - [Brown Bull](Brown_Bull "wikilink")
  - [White Bull](White_Bull "wikilink")
  - [Ostrich](Ostrich "wikilink")
  - [Bison](Bison "wikilink")
  - [Camel](Camel "wikilink")

\*The [Duck](Duck "wikilink"), [Raven](Raven "wikilink"), and
[Seagull](Seagull "wikilink") will fly away from the whistle sound, but
because the fly, they cannot be "herded".

## Herding Animals

Using a [saddled](saddle "wikilink") [horse](horse "wikilink") and a
[whistle](whistle "wikilink"), you may herd cattle and ostriches. All of
the above animals run from the whistle sound, so you can direct them by
changing ![ChestnutHorse2.PNG](ChestnutHorse2.PNG
"ChestnutHorse2.PNG")your position.

For example, if you want your herd to go forward, blow the whistle and
run behind them. When you want to make a turn, blow the whistle on
either side of the herd. If you want to go left, blow on the right side.
If you want to go right, blow on the left side.

It is easiest to do this on open land. If you try this in a forest, you
could be knocked off of your horse, or your herd could become broken up.

## Tips

Have an enclosure waiting for your animals when you arrive. I suggest
using cheap blocks (such as [Sand](Sand "wikilink") or
[Dirt](Dirt "wikilink")) to put around your fence. This way, your
animals can go in with ease, but cannot get out.

After your animals are in a fenced enclosure, build your fence up at
least 3 blocks high so that predators cannot harm your livestock.
Remember to remove your surrounding sand/dirt too\! Wooden fences are
technically NOT over one block high. Since tigers and werewolves can
jump three blocks, plus one more block if they happened to jump from the
back of another animal, wooden fences should be built 5 blocks high. Or
place some type of roof over the area. You could use fences as the roof
if it isn't in an area prone to lightning strikes.
