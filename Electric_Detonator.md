__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A detonator contains a small amount of sensitive explosion and is used
to initiate larger, less sensitive explosives, such as gunpowder kegs.
Because it is very sensitive, it will explode when hit by a hard object,
or when an electric current flows through it. Can be used to
electrically initiate explosives, with instant explosion. Can be placed
on any vertical or horizontal surface.*

## **Crafting**

To craft the detonator, use 4 [copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink")
and one [gunpowder](gunpowder "wikilink"). You get 10 detonators.

## Notes

  - This detonator has a small explosion, destroying just the blocks
    with very low explosion resilience around itself. This ability may
    be useful when making adventure maps.
  - They can be lit with a match, like the other explosives, however,
    electric detonators explode faster than gunpowder kegs when lit by
    hand.
  - A detonator will be set off by another explosion if it is within the
    blast radius. So, one detonator can set off others if they are close
    enough.
  - Any kind of throwable item or projectiles may ignite the detonator.
