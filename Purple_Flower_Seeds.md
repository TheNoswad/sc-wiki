## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Seeds are used to plant various types of plants, such as flowers, grass
and rye. Some plants need well tilled, moist and fertilized soil to grow
properly. Otherwise their growth will be stunted and they will not reach
full size.*

## Crafting

To obtain Purple Flower Seeds, place one purple flower into a crafting
table. You will get 3 seeds.

## Planting

To plant a purple flower seed, simply tap the top surface of a
[Dirt](Dirt "wikilink"), [Soil](Soil "wikilink"),
[Sand](Sand "wikilink") or [Grass](Grass "wikilink") block with the
seeds in your hand. A small green shoot will appear and will eventually
grow into full size.

  - It gives the least seeds of any flower.
  - This is the only flower used in paint.
