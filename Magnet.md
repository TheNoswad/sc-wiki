__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Magnets attract compass needles allowing you to find direction home
while out in the wild. Don't forget to place one close to your house\!
The compass will show direction to the nearest magnet, or to spawn
location if there are no magnets. You can only place a limited number of
magnets in the world.*

## Crafting

In order to craft a magnet, you will need 7 [Iron
Ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink"). Yields 1 Magnet.

## Uses

Magnets are used with a [Compass](Compass "wikilink"), usually to find
your way home. The compass will point you in the direction of the
closest magnet.

## Notes

  - You can place up to 6 magnets in your world, but it's best to not
    put them too close together or they may cause confusing compass
    readings.

<!-- end list -->

  - Like creatures and boats, if you try to place a lot of magnets close
    together, a message will appear saying "Too Many Magnets".Â
