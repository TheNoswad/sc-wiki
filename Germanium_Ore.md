__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Germanium ore are veins of germanium oxide embedded in basalt rock.
Gains germanium ore chunks when mined. Be careful, because certain ores
require special tools for successful mining of the mineral. If improper
tools are used, the mineral is lost.*

## Uses

It has no use other than mining it, it drops [Germanium Ore
Chunks](Germanium_Ore_Chunk "wikilink"). It can be successfully mined
with your hand in all game modes except [Adventure
mode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink"). 

## Notes

  - Germanium is found deep in the [basalt](basalt "wikilink") layer,
    often in very deep caves.
