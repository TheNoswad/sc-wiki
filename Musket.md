The Musket is a gun that can fire [Buckshot
Balls](Buckshot_Ball "wikilink"), [Buckshot](Buckshot "wikilink") and
[Musket Balls](Musket_Ball "wikilink"). [Buckshot](Buckshot "wikilink")
is a spread shot that is best for hunting birds and musket balls are
best for bigger animals although they can't bring down large animals
every time. A [buckshot ball](Buckshot_Ball "wikilink") is one ball from
a [buckshot](buckshot "wikilink") - it is enough to kill a bird but it
will merely annoy larger animals.\[1\] The single buckshot ball is not
intended for general use.

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A musket can be used to fire [Musket Balls](Musket_Ball "wikilink") or
[Buckshot](Buckshot "wikilink"). You can also fire single [buckshot
balls](Buckshot_Ball "wikilink"), but the shot is very inaccurate and
lacks power.*

## Crafting

Place 2 [iron blocks](Solid_Iron_Block "wikilink"), 2
[planks](planks "wikilink") and a [rod](rod "wikilink") as shown to get
one musket.

## Operation

To load the musket, open the edit panel (paper icon at the top-right).
Then items need to be dragged onto the musket in the following order:
[Gunpowder](Gunpowder "wikilink"), [Cotton Wad](Cotton_Wad "wikilink"),
and a [Musket Ball](Musket_Ball "wikilink"),
[Buckshot](Buckshot "wikilink") or a [Buckshot
Ball](Buckshot_Ball "wikilink").

To shoot the musket, make sure it is selected in your hotbar. Press and
hold the screen and a crosshair will show. Hold your finger until a
'click' sound is heard. Then, aim at the target and release your touch,
and the gun will fire. This is much the same as using a
[Crossbow](Crossbow "wikilink").

You can [sneak](Controls "wikilink") before selecting the musket from
the hotbar. This makes the crosshair move around less vigorously and the
shot is therefore more accurate.

## Notes

  - The musket has an unusually low durability, given the rare resources
    required to craft it.
  - Musket balls may not bring down large animals with one shot.
  - Bullets can hurt or kill you easily if they ricochet off something
    hard.
  - Musket Balls and Buckshot can explode [Gunpowder
    Kegs](Gunpowder_Kegs "wikilink") and [Incendiary
    Kegs](Incendiary_Kegs "wikilink")
  - Buckshot can kill smaller animals such as wolves in one hit when
    very close but is not recommended due to the risk of a ricochet.
  - Loading gunpowder in a Musket without any bullets will fire a blind
    shot. This can be used to scare away animals. A message also appears
    saying; "No bullet, blind shot fired" It makes no difference whether
    there is a cotton wad in the gun.

  - When shot, muskets produce a white smoky particle effect. This can
    obscure your target, making it difficult to initially see if the
    shot was a hit.
  - Shooting when in water will not trigger anything, but it will use up
    the [Gunpowder](Gunpowder "wikilink"), [Cotton
    Wad](Cotton_Wad "wikilink") and the
    [amm](Musket_Ball "wikilink")[uni](Buckshot "wikilink")[tion](Buckshot_Ball "wikilink")
    loaded in.
