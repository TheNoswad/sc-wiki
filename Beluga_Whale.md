## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A very large, non aggressive mammal that lives in deep ocean. Provides
plenty of food when hunted."*

## Description

Beluga Whales are mammals in Survivalcraft with a dolphin like
appearance and are white/light blue in color.

They are carnivores, meaning they will eat: Bacon
([raw](Raw_Bacon "wikilink") or [cooked](Cooked_Bacon "wikilink")), Bird
([raw](Raw_Bird "wikilink") or [cooked](Cooked_Bird "wikilink")), and
Fish ([raw](Raw_Fish "wikilink") or [cooked](Cooked_Fish "wikilink")).

Whales are hostile, and drop 15-20 [Raw Fish](Raw_fish "wikilink") when
killed.

## Appearance Biome

Beluga Whales spawn in oceans, far from shorelines.Â 

## Uses

Whales are very hostile and very hard to kill, so they can be hunted for
food, but it is advised you avoid them all together.

Whales are rare animals and do not have [spawner
eggs](Creative_Eggs "wikilink") in Creative game mode. Beluga Spawner is
encoded as 12320886. Therefore, you can replace the egg in hand with
this value by [editing the Project
file](Hacking_The_Project_File "wikilink").
