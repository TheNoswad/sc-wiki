## Description (from [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

''Shovels are tools for digging blocks made of loose material, such as
sand or gravel. They greatly speed up the digging process, but
eventually they will get damaged and fail. Shovels made of better
materials will last longer and dig faster. ''

## Crafting

Requires a [copper ingot](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and two
[sticks](stick "wikilink"). You get one shovel.
