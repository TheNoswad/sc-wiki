__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Pumpkins are large, orange vegetables that grow in groups of 5 to 10
plants. When collected they can be eaten or crafted into jack
O'Lanterns.*

## Description

Unripe pumpkins have 6 stages before they become ripe orange pumpkins.
On each stage, the pumpkin grows larger until it turns into a
fully-grown orange pumpkin.

Not all pumpkins will grow to maturity. Approximately 1/3 will stop
growing at some stage of development. You can tell they have stopped
growing when the vines disappear.

You cannot eat them when they're unripe but
[Boars](Wildboar "wikilink"), [Bears](Brown_Bear "wikilink"),
[Ostriches](Ostrich "wikilink"), and
[Cassowaries](Cassowary "wikilink")Â will eat these if dropped or thrown
on the ground or while trying to break one loose. So they can be used to
attract or feed these animals. You can lure these animals into a trap or
a farm by throwing the Pumpkins ahead of you then take the pumpkin back
and repeat the process over and over again.

## Notes

In [Creative mode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") the inventory only
lists 3 stages but when placed in inventory or a chest, the unripe
stages take up 6 slots and can only be stacked in the appropriate one.

In the 1.29 updates, you can use the seemingly useless Unripe Pumpkins
as ammo to shoot at animals to protect your base or such. This will
attract Bears or Ostriches or such to your base.
