## Notes

  - Much like standard Glass, It will shatter if a block of
    [Sand](Recipaedia/Terrain/Sand.md "wikilink") or [Gravel](Recipaedia/Terrain/Gravel.md "wikilink") falls on top
    of it.
  - Entites like [Signs](Sign "wikilink") cannot be placed on
    [Glass](Glass "wikilink"), framed glass or
    [Windows](Window "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - Framed glass and windows are flammable, unlike normal glass.

<!-- end list -->

  - To make a large window, place four framed glass blocks in a square.
    Then you have a large window.

<!-- end list -->

  - Framed glass and windows drop sticks.
