__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description

This is a source block of water. It is an unobtainable block in all game
modes. For more information on using water, see [Water
Bucket](Recipaedia/Tools/Water_Bucket.md "wikilink"). 

When a Water Bucket is 'placed', it will place a source block of water
(this block) at the designed location. Breaking an ice block will also
create a source block of water. 

Source blocks will try to combine to form a surface of still water, if
the source blocks are close enough. 

## Notes 

  - It will spread 7 blocks in all directions if not blocked by a fluid
    blocker. All placeable fluid blockers: Basalt, Bedrock, Birch Wood,
    Brick Wall, Chest, Clay, Coal Ore, Cobblestone, Copper Ore, Diamond
    Ore, Dirt, Dispenser, Framed Glass, Germanium Ore, Glass, Granite,
    Grass, Gravel, Ice, Iron Ore, Limestone, Malachite Block, Marble,
    Mimosa Wood, Oak Wood, Piston, Piston Head, Planks, Saltpeter Ore,
    Sand, Sandstone, Semiconductor Block, Soil, Solid Coal Block, Solid
    Copper Block, Solid Diamond Block, Solid Iron Block, Spruce Wood,
    Stone Bricks, Sulphur Ore, Window, Wire Through Bricks, Wire Through
    Cobblestone, Wire Through Planks, Wire Through Semiconductor, Wire
    Through Stone.

  - Flowing water from a source block breaks stairs, slabs and other
    items and destroys plants.
  - You can make an infinite water source by using only 2 source blocks
    of water. Make a 2x2 pit and place the source blocks in opposite
    corners. 
  - Flowing water can freeze into a full block and then be broken to
    form a 'free' source block. This is another method of an infinite
    water source.

  - People also use water as a water elevator due to fact that player
    can climb water really fast. Water also reduces fall damage. The
    "Watervator" is not recommended since version 1.26. Getting wet can
    now accelerate freezing to death. Wearing armor can prevent the
    character from jumping out of deep water and may cause you to sink
    to the bottom. 
  - Explosions underwater can cause minimal to no environmental damage.
    It will still damage you and any entity in the water, however.
  - Going into water will attract animals like barracudas and piranhas
    to come and attack you. When walking into muddy or sandy water, you
    may startle some rays, which will attack you also.
  - Wading in water will decrease your insulation and make you colder,
    which helps you to freeze faster. Water also makes your clothes and
    armor degrade faster. Simply switching clothes from your inventory
    will ***NOT*** prevent this, as all clothes are affected.
  - Wetness will dry faster if you are near fire.
  - [Sea Urchin](Recipaedia/Plants/Sea_Urchin.md "wikilink"),
    [Starfish](Recipaedia/Plants/Starfish.md "wikilink"), [Kelp](Recipaedia/Plants/Kelp.md "wikilink") and
    [Seagrass](Recipaedia/Plants/Seagrass.md "wikilink") are the only blocks that can be
    placed inside a source block of water. Water can spread on them
    without being blocked.

  - 1.8- Directional water spreading added; water can be collected by
    bucket
  - 1.15- Water, along with magma, could now be customized in texture
    packs

    along with magma, have ambient sound effects; bug that affects
