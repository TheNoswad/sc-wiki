## Description (from [Bestiary](Bestiary "wikilink"))

*"A large, dangerous mammal omnivore. Will chase anything that
approaches it. Fairly slow, but powerful. Unlike Brown Bear, likes
colder areas. Not edible, but provides fur when hunted."*

## Description

Bears are mammals in Survivalcraft and spawn in 3 varieties:
[Brown](Brown_Bear "wikilink"), Black, and
[Polar](Polar_Bear "wikilink"). Black Bears have a black coat and
lighter colored snout.

All three bears are omnivores, meaning they will eat meat and plants.
Bears will eat: Bacon
([raw ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bacon)or [cooked](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Cooked_Bacon)),
Bird
([raw ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Bird)or [cooked](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Cooked_Bird)),
and Fish
([raw ](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Raw_Fish)or [cooked](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Cooked_Fish)), [pumpkins](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Pumpkin),
and [bread](bread "wikilink").

Bears are hostile, meaning they will attack you on sight. If you kill
the bears, however, the reward is great. They drop [Fur](Fur "wikilink")
and [Rotten Meat](Rotten_Meat "wikilink") when killed.

## Appearance Biome

Black Bears spawn in caves and wastelands.

## Uses

Bears drop [Fur](Fur "wikilink"), so they are useful to make heavy
clothing.

Black Bear can be spawned in [Creative
Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") using a [Spawner
Egg.](Creative_Eggs "wikilink")
