## Description (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A solid block of semiconductor.*

## Crafting

Use 9 [germanium crystals](Germanium_Crystal "wikilink") to craft 1
semiconductor block.

</div>

## Use

The semiconductor block is used to craft the [different
pistons.](Piston "wikilink")

## Notes

  - These are NOT similar to the solid blocks of other mineral because
    those are essentially concentrated forms of the mineral chunks. Once
    the semiconductor block is made it CANNOT be converted back into
    germanium crystals.
  - While the best tool for [Wire Through
    Semiconductor](Wire_Through_Semiconductor "wikilink") are axes,
    pickaxes are the recommended tools for this block.
