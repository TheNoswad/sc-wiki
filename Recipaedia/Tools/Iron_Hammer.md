## Uses

An iron hammer is used to make furniture pieces. You create a structure
made of specific blocks, and then tap on the structure with the hammer
to make the furniture block. Check the [Furniture](Furniture "wikilink")
page for more details.

They may be used as a weapon but are no more effective than a
[stick](stick "wikilink").

## Notes

  - The hammer is one of the items that are not recommended to hold in
    your hand except when you are using it.
