__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__ The compass is a tool used in
Survivalcraft to help you find your way back home when you stray off too
far.

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Compass points to the location of the place of last sleep or to the
nearest magnet, if present. It is indispensable when finding your way
home on far away journeys.*

## How Does The Compass Work?

The compass needle will point to the location of the nearest
[magnet](magnet "wikilink"). If no magnets have been placed in your
world, the needle will point to your last sleeping spot. And if you have
just created a new world and not yet slept, it will point to the shore
where you first spawned.

## Crafting

Requires 1 diamond and 4 copper ingots. You get one compass.
