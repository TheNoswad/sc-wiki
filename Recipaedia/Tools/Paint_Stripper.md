## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A bucket full of paint stripper.Can be used to strip paint from
previously painted surfaces and bring them to original appearance.*

## Crafting

Place a [Bucket of water](Water_Bucket.md "wikilink") and a [saltpeter
chunk](../Minerals/Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink") in the furnace. You get one bucket of
paint stripper. ![Paint_Stripper_craft.jpg](Paint_Stripper_craft.jpg

## Use

To strip paint from painted blocks, use just like any [paint
bucket](Paint_Bucket.md "wikilink") but instead of adding a color, this
will remove any previously applied colors. Place the bucket in your
hotbar and ONLY select it when you are ready to use it. Then tap the
block or item you wish to restore and all the paint will be removed from
it.

You can also use the Paint Stripper to remove dye from
[clothes](../Clothes/Clothing.md "wikilink") and [carpets](../Items/Carpet.md "wikilink"). To do
so, smelt the item with a paint stripper bucket in the
[Furnace](../Items/Furnace.md "wikilink").
