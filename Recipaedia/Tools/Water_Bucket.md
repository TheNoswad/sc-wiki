__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Bucket is a container made of copper and used to carry fluids, such as
water, magma or milk. Bucket can be filled with the fluid at a source
block and transported to a different location, where the source block
can be placed to start a new body of fluid. You cannot fill the bucket
from a non-source block.*

The water bucket is a [bucket](bucket "wikilink") that has been filled
with [water](water "wikilink").

## Filling a Bucket with water

Take an empty bucket, find a source of water - any standing water will
work and hold the bucket in your hand.

Go to the water source and tap the water. The bucket will be filled with
the water. If you chose an infinite source, the source will re-establish
itself.

## Use

The water bucket is used to transport a source block of water. The water
can be used to:

  - Create new bodies of water such as a swimming pool or a pond. You
    should use several water buckets for this.
  - Hydrate soil for planting and growing crops - see
    [farming](farming "wikilink") page
  - Create flowing water to clear ground of all plants (and many other
    blocks)
  - Create a column of water to use as an elevator

<!-- end list -->

  - Water can be used while running away from animals that don't jump
    too high when you are being chased too close. Spill some water
    between you and the animal. This will give you more time to run
    away.
  - You can make walls of water to slow down animals. Make some walls of
    water at places where you are constantly threatened by predators.
    while they chase you run through the gaps you made in it and the
    predetors will follow you straight through the water that will give
    you more time.

## Notes 

  - Water bucket is stackable to 40, but ONLY in the inventory. You can
    only stack 1 in the hotbar.
  - Any block that is NOT a fluid blocker (stairs, fences, etc.) will
    'pop' if water flows onto them. This means you can destroy a lot of
    work unless you're careful when placing the water.
  - If you have a water bucket in your hand, doors and chests will NOT
    open. Instead of opening the door, you will place the water ON the
    door and this will make the door pop off\!
  - The water in the buckets are animated.
  - They were added in the 1.8 update.
