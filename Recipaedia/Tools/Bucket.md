## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink")) 

*Bucket is a container made of copper and used to carry fluids, such as
water, magma or milk. Bucket can be filled with the fluid at a source
block and transported to a different location, where the source block
can be placed to start a new body of fluid. You cannot fill the bucket
from a non-source block. *

## Crafting

To craft a bucket, you will need 3 [copper
ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") . You get one bucket.

</div>

## Uses

Buckets hold [milk](Milk_Bucket.md "wikilink"),
[water](Water_Bucket.md "wikilink"), [magma](Magma_Bucket.md "wikilink"), [all
of the various colors of paint](Paint_Bucket.md "wikilink"), and [paint
stripper](Paint_Stripper "wikilink"). 

## Notes

  - Bucket is stackable to 40, but ONLY in the inventory. You can only
    stack 1 in the hotbar.
  - You should have a bucket in your hand ONLY while you are using it.
    If you try to open a door or chest while holding the bucket, you
    will pour the bucket out, instead. This may ruin your work or even
    kill the character\! (If this happens with water, the water can be
    "extinguished" by placing any placeable item such as a torch or leaf
    block on the spot where the bucket was emptied.)

<!-- end list -->

  - They are not placeable and not throwable objects.
