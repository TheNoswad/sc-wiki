## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Pickaxes are tools for quarrying hard blocks, such as stone and ice.
They greatly speed up the quarrying process, but eventually they will
get damaged and fail. Pickaxes made of better materials will last longer
and quarry faster.*

## Crafting

It takes 3 [copper ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and 2
[sticks](Stick "wikilink") to craft one copper pickaxe.
