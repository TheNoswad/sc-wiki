__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Axes are tools for cutting soft blocks, such as wood, furniture or
leaves. They greatly speed up the cutting process, but eventually they
will get damaged and fail. Axes made of better materials will last
longer and cut faster. Axe is also a powerful weapon, although it is
very difficult to hit a moving target. *

## Crafting

Requires 3 [Planks](../Construction/Planks.md "wikilink") and 2
[sticks](stick "wikilink").

rate.
