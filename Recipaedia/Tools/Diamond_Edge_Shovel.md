__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") ) 

*Shovels are tools for digging blocks made of loose material, such as
sand or gravel. They greatly speed up the digging process, but
eventually they will get damaged and fail. Shovels made of better
materials will last longer and dig faster. *

## Crafting

Crafting requires 3 [diamonds](../Minerals/Diamond.md "wikilink") and an [Iron
Shovel](Iron_Shovel.md "wikilink").

## Notes

  - The shovel does not have to be newly made to be coated with diamond.
    You can coat a worn item and it will be as good as new.
