__NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Pistons can be used to push and pull blocks. The extention of piston is
controlled by voltage applied to it. 0.8 v will extend piston 1 block,
0.9 v two, etc.1.5V will extend a piston a maximum of 8 blocks. Pistons
can also be edited to limit the maximum extention to lower values. If
the piston is a pull piston it will also pull one block back when
retracting. If the piston is a strick pull piston, it will not pull back
unless it is pulling back a block.*

This is the pulling piston which will also pull back blocks that are
touching it.

## Crafting

It takes 1 [Copper Ingot](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and 1
[Piston](Piston.md "wikilink") to craft 1 pulling piston.

<div style="overflow:hidden">

</div>

NOTE: The piston must be reset to its starting settings or the crafting
table will not accept it. That is, the max extention must be 8 and the
speed must be fast.

## Use

Place the piston where you want it. It is a directional block like the
[Dispenser](Dispenser "wikilink") and will be aimed at you when you
place it.

### Editing it

Open its UI by making it center in the screen when you are close enough.
The sneak button will turn into the edit icon (sheet paper). Tap that
icon. The following window opens up:

<div style="overflow:hidden">

![Pulling_Piston_UI.jpg](Pulling_Piston_UI.jpg
"Pulling_Piston_UI.jpg")

</div>

From this window you can adjust the piston's speed, the maximum distance
that it will extend and how many blocks it will pull back.

## Notes

  - See [the Piston page](Piston.md#Moveable_Items_Lists "wikilink") for
    the lists of piston-abled and piston-blocker items.
  - Pistons were added in V2.0
