## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Pistons can be used to push and pull blocks. The extention of piston is
controlled by voltage applied to it. 0.8 v will extend piston 1 block,
0.9 v two, etc.1.5V will extend a piston a maximum of 8 blocks. Pistons
can also be edited to limit the maximum extention to lower values. If
the piston is a pull piston it will also pull one block back when
retracting. If the piston is a strick pull piston, it will not pull back
unless it is pulling back a block.*

This is the strict pull piston which does not pull back unless there are
the proper amount of blocks attached to it.

## Crafting

It takes 1 [Copper Ingot](../Items/Copper_Ingot.md "wikilink") and a
[Piston](Piston.md "wikilink") to craft 1 strict-pull piston.

<div style="overflow:hidden">

![Strict_Pull_Piston_crafting.jpg](Strict_Pull_Piston_crafting.jpg
"Strict_Pull_Piston_crafting.jpg")

</div>

NOTE: The plain piston must be reset to its starting settings or the
crafting table will not accept it. That is, the max extention must be 8
and the speed must be fast.

## Use

Place the piston where you want it. It is a directional block like the
[Dispenser](../Items/Dispenser.md "wikilink") and will be aimed at you when you
place it.

This piston is a special case and can be very useful in a wide variety
of applications. It is necessary to make compact [Piston
Lifts](../../Guides/Piston_Lifts.md "wikilink"). With this piston, some very complex
machines may be designed.

You can think of it as having a 'block detector' built into it. Once
extended, it will not retract until the proper number of blocks is
in-line. It can detect if a sand-fall trap has been triggered when
placed carefully. It can even be used in mining to tell if there's an
open space beyond a cave wall (within 8 blocks).

### Editing it

Open its UI by making it center in the screen when you are close enough.
The sneak button will turn into the edit icon (sheet paper). Tap that
icon. The following window opens up:

<div style="overflow:hidden">

![Strict_Pulling_Piston_UI.jpg](Strict_Pulling_Piston_UI.jpg
"Strict_Pulling_Piston_UI.jpg")

</div>

From this window you can adjust the piston's speed, the maximum distance
it will extend trying to touch a block and the maximum number of blocks
it will pull back.

    the lists of piston-abled and piston-blocker items.
  - Pistons were added in V2.0
