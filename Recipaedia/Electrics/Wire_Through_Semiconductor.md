## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A semiconductor block with a wire running across a hole drilled through
the middle. This block can conduct electricity when both ends of the
embedded wire are \[a\] connected to something. This block can be placed
with ends pointing north/south, east/west or up/down. It is very useful
when there is a need to run electricity through solid walls, or to
insulate the wire from unwanted connections with other wires.*

## Crafting

Uses 6 [germanium crystals](Germanium_Crystal "wikilink") and 3
[electric wires](Electric_Wire.md "wikilink") to craft. You get 3 Wire
Through Semiconductors.

## Use

This block is used to transfer electric signals. By using this block,
you can make your designs more compact. It will also help hide any wires
from the user. When the block is placed, the wire opening will be facing
the character.
