## **Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )**

*A light emitting diode. When connected to a power source emits weak
colored light. The color of the light depends on the value of signal
aplied to the diode. 0.8V or above produces light of 8 different colors.
The light is too weak to light up the surroundings, but it's easily
visible. It has inputs on all sides for easy connection and can be
placed on any horizontal or vertical surface.*

## Crafting

Crafting Multicolored LEDs require 3 [copper
ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink"), one [glass](glass "wikilink") and one
[electric wire](Electric_Wire.md "wikilink"). You get 4 Multicolored LEDs.

## Use

  - Simply run a wire from them to any power source or signal line. They
    can also be connected by a wire-through-block.
  - It is an 'analog' device, so they can change the color depending of
    the battery volts.
  - It can be used to mark your paths or your house but without lighting
    up the surroundings.
