## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Logic NAND gate. Has two inputs on the sides and one output. The output
is 0 when both inputs are 1, otherwise it is 1. Can be placed on any
surface and rotated to desired orientation.*

## Crafting

Requires 4 [germanium crystals](germanium_Crystal "wikilink") and 3
[copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink"). You get 4 NAND gates.

## Hooking It Up

### Connections

This is a standard [AND gate](Logic_AND_Gate.md "wikilink") with a built-in
[NOT gate](Logic_NOT_Gate.md "wikilink") after it. See those pages for more
information. This arrangement allows for more compact circuits.

## Notes

  - NAND gates are primarily digital devices but will operate on analog
    signals. It performs a bitwise NAND. This allows for more compact
    and interesting circuit designs. See [Using Analog
    Signals](Using_Analog_Signals "wikilink").
