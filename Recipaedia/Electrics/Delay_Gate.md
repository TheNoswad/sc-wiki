## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A delay gate with one input and one output. A single gate will delay
any signal for about 0.2 seconds. Chaining 2 gates directly (without a
wire in between), gives a delay of 1 second. Chaining 3 gates directly
gives a delay of 5 seconds. Chaining delay gates with a wire between
simply combines the delays. Two gates will give a delay of 0.4 second, 3
gates will give 0.6 seconds, and so on. Can be placed on any surface and
rotated to desired orientation.*

__________________________________

Simply put, the output just copies the input a short time later.

## Crafting

The delay gate requires 3 [copper ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and 4
[germanium crystals](Germanium_Crystal "wikilink") to craft. You get 4
gates.

## Delay Times

You can combine delays connected directly or through wires to get a wide
choice of delay times. When chained directly, each gate after the second
adds about 4 seconds to the delay. A 6 gate direct delay gives 17
seconds delay. If you need an 18 second delay, direct connect 6 gates
then a wire then a 2 gate direct pair. All these times are approximate.
The table shows several delay gate combinations and the delays obtained.
Direct means that the gates are joined WITHOUT any wires between them.
The delays are all expressed in seconds.

| Delay gates | Wires | Direct |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1           | (0.2) | (0.2)  |
| 2           | 0.4   | 1      |
| 3           | 0.6   | 5      |
| 4           | 0.8   | 9      |
| 5           | 1     | 13     |

## Notes

  - The new [adjustable delay gate](Adjustable_Delay_Gate.md "wikilink")
    can replace this gate for many applications - especially for the
    multi-gate delay setups described above.
