__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*An adjustable delay gate with one input and one output. The delay of
the gate can be adjusted in 0.1 seconds increments by editing it. Can be
placed on any surface and rotated to desired orientation.*

## Crafting

The delay gate requires an [iron ingot](Iron_Ingot "wikilink"), 2
[copper ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink") and 4 [germanium
crystals](Germanium_Crystal "wikilink") to craft. You get 4 gates.

## Use

Place the delay gate as you would any other gate. Approach the delay and
get it centered in the screen. An edit icon will appear over the crouch
icon. Tap the edit icon and a control window will pop up. Use the
controls in the window to set the delay to your desired value. The delay
can be from 10 to 2,560 ms (0.01 - 2.56 seconds).

The delay can also be set while the gate is in the character's hand,
just like the [memory bank](memory_Bank "wikilink").

## Notes

  - A single [fixed delay gate](Delay_Gate "wikilink") has a delay of
    0.2 seconds, or 200 ms. This gate has a minimum delay of 10 ms, or
    is up to 20 times faster.
  - The maximum delay is 2600 ms so can be over 10 times longer than a
    single fixed delay gate. Chained delay gates go up to 4000 ms per
    gate, so if you need a lot of delay, they are more efficient.
  - The delay isn't altered if two adjustable delay gates are close to
    each other or if there's a wire between them, unlike traditional
    delay gate.
  - You can distinguish the Adjustable Delay Gate from the fixed [Delay
    Gate](Delay_Gate "wikilink") due to the black bordered "D" in the
    top face. but could be different with created block textures.
  - Like the battery, Adjustable Delay Gates will go to your creative
    inventory when you collect them on creative mode.
