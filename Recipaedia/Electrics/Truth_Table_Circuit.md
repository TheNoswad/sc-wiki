__NOEDITSECTION__

A Truth Table is a small programmable logic device.

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A programmable circuit that uses a user-entered truth table to
determine value of the output for all possible combinations of the
inputs. There are 4 inputs on all sides and one output at the back (to
access the output element must be placed on a Wire-Through-Block). The
truth table must be entered manually by tapping edit button while
holding the item in hand. Truth table contains output values for all
possible input value combinations. Can be placed on any vertical surface
and rotated to desired orientation.*

### NOTES on description:

<span font-size:8px>The Recipaedia's description has two omissions.
First, the output signal is a standard digital signal - NOT an analog
signal. So, the only values available for this output are '0' or '1'.
Second, the Truth Table CAN be edited after it's placed, in the same
fashion as the memory bank. Simply walk up close to it and center your
view on the device. The edit icon will appear.<span> </span></span>

## Crafting

It requires 5 [copper ingots](../Items/Copper_Ingot.md "wikilink") and 2 [germanium
crystals](../Minerals/Germanium_Crystals.md "wikilink") to craft Truth tables. You get
4 chips. ![Truth_Table_Circuit.png](Truth_Table_Circuit.png

## Connections

The 4 inputs are on the sides of the device and are standard digital
signals. In1 is the side with one dot. In2 is the side with two dots,
and so forth. The output is sent out the back so this device MUST be
placed on a [wire through block](Wire_Through_Planks.md "wikilink") to be
useful. All inputs and the output are standard digital signals.

## Operation

The Truth Table is a generic programmable logic device with one output.
It is essentially a very small memory bank and can be used in place of
several discrete logic gates provided you only need the one output. Once
it is programmed, the output will only turn on ('1') only for the input
combinations that are programmed for it.

## Programming it

Walk up to the device and keep it centered in your view. When you are
close enough, the SNEAK button will change to an EDIT button (a pencil
and paper). Press this to enter the edit mode. A simple chart will pop
up. Notice the input designations at the top of the chart and the grid
of '0's and '1's in the main part. These show all the possible
combinations of inputs. Scroll through these and find the combination(s)
which you want to activate the output. Tap on the check box on the right
and see that a check mark is entered. This means that a '1' will be
output for that particular combination. When you are done programming
the device, exit by tapping OK.

The LINEAR button will allow you to enter all output value in one line,
instead of checking off boxes. This must be a string of '0's and '1's,
up to 16 digits.

## Uses

It can be used in a simple 4-switch locking device with no extra parts
needed.

It can replace a number of other logic gates to keep a circuit smaller.

## History 

The truth Table was introduced in version 1.23.

## Notes

  - Despite Recipaedia's description, Truth Table Circuits can be placed
    on horizontal surfaces too as for 1.29.
