__NOEDITSECTION__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Logic AND gate. Has two inputs on the sides and one output. The output
is 1 when both inputs are 1, otherwise it is 0. Can be placed on any
surface and rotated to desired orientation.*

## Crafting

Requires 4 germaium crystals and 3 copper ingots. You get 4 AND gates.

## Hooking It Up

### Connections

The output is on the side of the block that has the 'rounded' part of
the symbol. The inputs are the 2 sides next to that side. The opposite
side has no connections.

### Graphical Symbol

AND Gate has 2 inputs \[ Labeled A and B in Red \] and 1 output \[ In
Blue \]

### Truth Table

Truth Table shows all input combinations and how the output responds.

| Inputs        | Output |
| ------------- | ------ |
| A           B | Y      |
| 0             | 0      |
| 0             | 1      |
| 1             | 0      |
| 1             | 1      |

To demonstrate this, I am going to represent 0 with Blue and 1 with Red.

## Notes

  - AND gates are primarily digital devices but will operate on analog
    signals. It performs a bitwise AND. This allows for more compact and
    interesting circuit designs. See [Using Analog
    Signals](Using_Analog_Signals "wikilink").
  - AND Gate finds the Minimum between 2 binary digits, unlike the
    [Logic OR Gate](Logic_OR_Gate.md "wikilink"), which finds the Maximum.
