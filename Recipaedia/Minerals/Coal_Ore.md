This page only covers the naturally occurring Coal Ore Block. For more
information, see the [Coal Chunk](Coal_Chunk "wikilink") or [Solid Coal
Block](Solid_Coal_Block "wikilink") pages.

 __NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Coal ore is a vein of coal embedded in granite rock. Gains coal chunks
when mined. Be careful, because certain ores require special tools for
successful mining of the mineral. If improper tools are used, the
mineral is lost.*

## Uses

Coal Ore is only obtainable in creative mode. When it is broken in any
mode, you will get 2-3 [Coal Chunks](Coal_Chunk "wikilink"). It can be
successfully mined with only your hand, in all modes except [Adventure
mode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink"). 

## Notes

  - Coal is very common and can often be visible on the surface, or in
    shallow caves.
  - In heavy veins of coal, [Solid Coal
    Blocks](Solid_Coal_Block "wikilink") may also be present.
