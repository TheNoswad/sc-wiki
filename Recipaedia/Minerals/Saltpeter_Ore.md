__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Saltpeter ore is a vein of potassium nitrate embedded in sandstone
rock. Gains saltpeter chunks when mined. Be careful, because certain
ores require special tools for successful mining of the mineral. If
improper tools are used, the mineral is lost. Saltpeter can be used to
make explosives.*

## Use

Saltpeter Ore is only obtainable in [Creative
mode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"). When broken it drops 2 [Saltpeter
Chunks,](Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink") which can be used as fertilizer and
in making [gunpowder](gunpowder "wikilink") . It can be successfully
mined with your hand in all game modes except [Adventure
mode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink"). 

## Notes

  - Saltpeter is usually found close to the surface under a few layers
    of [sand](sand "wikilink"). It can also be found in shallow
    sandstone caves. Beaches, deserts, anywhere that harbors sandstone
    is a good place to look.
  - To fertilize soil, simply tap it with the Saltpeter in hand.
