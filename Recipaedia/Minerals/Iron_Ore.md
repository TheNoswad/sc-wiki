  __NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Iron ore is a vein of iron oxide embedded in basalt rock. Gains iron
ore chunks when mined. Be careful, because certain ores require special
tools for successful mining of the mineral. If improper tools are used,
the mineral is lost. Further processing in the furnace is required to
extract the pure iron from the oxide*.

## Use

It has no use other than mining it to obtain [Iron Ore
Chunks](Iron_Ore_Chunk.md "wikilink")   

## Trivia

  - The iron ore in Survival Craft is likely based off hematite, the
    most common producer of iron in real life.
