__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A chunk of pure coal. Can be used for fuelling the furnace and as an
ingredient of various substances, like gunpowder. Used as a region when
reducing metal ores to pure metals. Also used as a pigment for making
darker hues of paint. In absence of mineral coal, you can burn wood in
an oxygen=poor atmosphere in the furnace and obtain a similar substance:
charcoal.*

## Obtaining

Like [diamonds](diamond "wikilink"), coal can be gained in several ways:

**Mining:** Up to 3 chunks may be extracted from one [coal
ore](Coal_Ore.md "wikilink") block with any tool.

**Charcoal:** Putting 2 wood in furnace input slots will transform the
blocks into a coal chunk.

**Blocks:** Putting a [solid coal block](Solid_Coal_Block "wikilink")
into any crafting interface will split it into 9 chunks. Coal blocks can
be found naturally in some heavy coal ore veins.

## Notes

Can be thrown, like other chunks. Will only do minimal damage.

It is better to use Coal Chunks for fuel instead of Solid Coal Blocks
since Solid Coal Blocks only have a fuel value of 600 each. Where 9 Coal
Chunks have a total value of 720 fuel value, better than Solid Coal
Blocks by a total of 120 more fuel values.
