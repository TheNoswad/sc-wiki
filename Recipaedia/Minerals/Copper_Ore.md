## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Copper ore is a vein of green copper carbonate embedded in granite.
Gains malachite chunks when mined. Be careful, because certain ores
require special tools for successful mining of the mineral. If improper
tools are used, the mineral is lost. Further processing in the furnace
is required to extract pure copper from the carbonate.*

Copper Ore blocks are only obtainable in [Creative
mode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"). When broken, they will drop 2-3
[Malachite Chunks](Malachite_Chunk "wikilink") . 

## Notes

  - Smelt
    [Malachite](Malachite_Chunk "wikilink")[Chunks](Malachite_Chunk "wikilink")
    in a [furnace](furnace "wikilink") to get [copper
    ingots](Copper_Ingot "wikilink").
  - Copper ore can be found in the [granite](granite "wikilink") layer
    as of version 1.29.
  - You can mine copper ore with your hand in any gamemode except
    [Adventure mode](Adventure_Gamemode "wikilink"). 
  - If needed, you can fuse Malachite Chunks together in a 3X3 pattern
    to get a [Malachite Block](Malachite_Block "wikilink"), which can be
    stacked to 40, saving space. This is the only solid block that will
    stack to 40.

by smelting [Malachite Chunk](Malachite_Chunk "wikilink") in a
[furnace](furnace "wikilink").
