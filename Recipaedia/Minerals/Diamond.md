## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Diamond is a crystal of pure carbon. Very rare and beautiful, It can be
found deep underground. It can be used for making extremely hard and
durable tools. Being carbon, it can be burned as fuel in the furnace,
but only fools waste this precious substance on such a mundane purpose.*

## Acquiring Diamonds

Diamonds can be obtained a variety of ways:

  - **Mining:** Diamonds are typically found 6-12 layers above
    [bedrock](bedrock "wikilink"), and each vein will contain 1-6
    [diamond ore](Diamond_Ore.md "wikilink") blocks. You must have a
    [copper pickaxe](Copper_Pickaxe "wikilink") or better to mine.
  - **Killing Werewolves:** Diamonds can be dropped upon the death of a
    [werewolf](werewolf "wikilink"). There is a 4% chance of acquiring
    diamonds in this manner.
  - **Diamond Blocks:** Nine gems can be retrieved from one [solid
    diamond block](Solid_Diamond_Block "wikilink").

## Uses

  - Diamonds can be used to strengthen iron [armor](armour "wikilink"),
    [tools](:Category:Tools "wikilink") and

  - Used to make [solid diamond blocks](Solid_Diamond_Block "wikilink").
