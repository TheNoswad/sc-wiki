## Description Â  (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A piece of cooked fish meat. A very tasty and nutritious meal.*

## Crafting

It is made by cooking [raw fish](Raw_Fish.md "wikilink") in a
[furnace](Furnace "wikilink").

## Notes

  - It can also be made by setting a fish on fire with a
    [Match](../Tools/Match.md "wikilink") or a [Fire Arrow.](../Weapons/Fire_Arrow.md "wikilink")
    This does not always work since the meat may also burn up in the
    fire. Plus the fish has to be removed from water, first.
  - If a fish is killed by a lightning it may drop cooked fish.
  - If it is dropped near a predator, the predator will try to eat it.
    You can use these to lure them to a trap or such.
  - They can be stacked up to 40 in the hotbar, as opposed to 12 in the
    inventory.
