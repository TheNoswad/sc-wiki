## Notes

Food rots when left alone for a period. Rotten food is dangerous to eat
as it can cause you to get [sick](Sickness "wikilink"). Dough is not
able to be eaten on its own, but can still rot. Rotten dough can not be
cooked and serves no purpose. It's also the only rotten food that can't
be eaten at all.
