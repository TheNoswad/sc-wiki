## Description Â  (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Cooked meat. A very tasty and nutritious meal.*

## Crafting

It is made by cooking [raw meat](Raw_Meat.md "wikilink") in a
[furnace](furnace "wikilink").

## Notes

  - It can also be made by killing an animal using fire with a
    [Match](../Tools/Match.md "wikilink") or a [Fire Arrow](../Weapons/Fire_Arrow.md "wikilink"),
    however it only works if the animal drops raw meat when killed, and
    it won't drop other items it would normally drop if killed with
    fire. This does not always work since the meat may also burn up in
    the fire.
  - If an animal is killed by a lighting, and the animal drops raw meat
    when killed, it will drop cooked meat instead. It will not drop
    other items it would normally drop, however.
  - If it is dropped near a predator, the predator will try to eat it.
    You can however, use these to lure them to a trap or such. [Rotten
    meat](Rotten_Meat.md "wikilink") and [Raw meat](Raw_Meat.md "wikilink")
    works too.
  - Before version 2.1, it was called Cooked Bacon and had a 2D sprite -
    ![Cooked_old_bacon.png](Cooked_old_bacon.png
    "Cooked_old_bacon.png").
  - As of 2.1, it can rot. After 15 days, this item will turn into
    [Rotten meat](Rotten_Meat.md "wikilink"), which should not be eaten.
  - Cooked meat is the most nutritious food item in the game, restoring
    almost the entire hunger bar.
