__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Bucket full of milk, can be consumed. Milk is obtained by milking a
cow. Be careful of nearby bulls, because they will attack once they
sense that someone is too near the cows. Once milked, a cow will slowly
regenerate the milk, and after some time it will be available for
milking again.*

## Crafting

A milk bucket is not crafted. Milk is collected in a
[bucket](bucket "wikilink") from cows.

## Use

Place a bucket in your hotbar and hold it in your hand (select it).
Approach a cow and tap the cow. The bucket will fill up with milk.

Drink the milk by entering the "body" portion of the User Interface and
dragging the milk to "eat" it. The empty bucket will remain in your
inventory.

## Notes

  - Milk can be stacked up to 12 in the hotbar only.
  - Milk will restore quite a bit of hunger. The food value is 0.1.
  - [Black cows](Black_Cow "wikilink") regenerate milk faster than
    [brown cows](Brown_Cow "wikilink").
  - Milk left alone for a while may spoil and become [Spoiled
    Milk](Spoiled_Milk "wikilink").
