__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description Â  (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A piece of cooked bird meat. Very tasty and nutritious meal.*

## Crafting

It is made by cooking [raw bird](Raw_Bird.md "wikilink") in a
[furnace](furnace "wikilink").

## Notes

  - It can also be made by setting the bird on fire with a
    [Match](../Tools/Match.md "wikilink") or a [Fire Arrow.](../Weapons/Fire_Arrow.md "wikilink")
    This does not always work since the meat may also burn up in the
    fire.

  - If a bird is killed by a lightning bolt, it may drop cooked bird.

    inventory.
