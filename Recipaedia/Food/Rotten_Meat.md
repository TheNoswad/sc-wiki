## DescriptionÂ (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Rotten meat. Do not eat.*

## Notes

Rotten meat is dropped by various predatory animals when killed, such as
[wolves](../../Bestiary/Wolf.md "wikilink"). [Raw Meat](Raw_Meat "wikilink") rots if left
alone for a period of time. It is dangerous to eat rotten meat as it can
cause you to be [sick](Sickness "wikilink").

Rotten meat can still be consumed by animals and does not harm them. It
attracts them, and is useful for traps. It is best to cook food to
preserve it.
