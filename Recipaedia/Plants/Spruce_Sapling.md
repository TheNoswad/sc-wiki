## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Saplings are used to plant trees. You can obtain them by crafting from
the leaves of trees. When planting, be careful to place the saplings in
a well lit place, full of moisture and of correct temperature. Use
hygrometer and thermometer to measure these quantities. Oaks like it
warm, Birches moderately cool and Spruces cold. All trees need a lot of
humidity. If you plant a sapling in a wrong spot, it will wilt into a
dry bush.*

## Crafting

To obtain Spruce Saplings, put Spruce Leaves in the
[Workbench](Crafting_Table "wikilink"). Each leaf yields one sapling.Â 

## Uses

Saplings are used to grow trees. Saplings must be kept in a well lit
area on [dirt](dirt "wikilink") or [Grass](../Terrain/Grass.md "wikilink"). Spruce
Saplings need to be planted in cold [biomes](biomes "wikilink").

## Notes

  - Saplings, if successfully grown, will consume a block of dirt under
    it and replace it will a "root", an extra piece of wood. (Thanks to
    Stanimus for pointing this out)
  - Saplings provide half the fuel value of leaves (0.5 fuel compared to
    leaves' fuel value of 1), so it is wise to use leaves for fuel
    instead of saplings.
