## <span style="font-size:20px;">Planting</span>

Pumpkin seeds grow best in tilled and moist soil. To plant, approach the
chosen soil/dirt/grass block with seeds in your hand and tap/click the
top of that block. A small sprout should appear. Be patient, your crops
may take a while to grow. Do not harvest your pumpkins before they are
big, orange and round; unripe pumpkins are inedible, however they may be
used as food for animals that eat pumpkins.
