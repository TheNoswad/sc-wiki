## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Seeds are used to plant various types of plants, such as flowers, grass
and rye. Some plants need well tilled, moist and fertilized soil to grow
properly. Otherwise their growth will be stunted and they will not reach
full size.*

## Crafting

To obtain Red Flower Seeds, place one red flower into a crafting table.
You will get 4 seeds. ![Red_flower_seeds..jpg](Red_flower_seeds..jpg

## Planting

To plant a red flower seed, simply tap the top surface of a
[Dirt](../Terrain/Dirt.md "wikilink"), [Soil](../Terrain/Soil.md "wikilink"),
[Sand](../Terrain/Sand.md "wikilink") or [Grass](../Terrain/Grass.md "wikilink") block with the
seeds in your hand. A small green shoot will appear and eventually grow
into full size.

## Notes

  - It gives the third most seeds of any flower.
