## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Saplings are used to plant trees. You can obtain them by crafting from
the leaves of trees. When planting, be careful to place the saplings in
a well lit place, full of moisture and of correct temperature. Use
hygrometer and thermometer to measure these quantities. Oaks like it
warm, Birches moderately cool and Spruces cold. All trees need a lot of
humidity. If you plant a sapling in a wrong spot, it will wilt into a
[Dry Bush](Dry_Bush "wikilink").*

## Crafting

To obtain Tall Spruce Saplings, put [tall spruce
leaves](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Tall_Spruce_Leaves) in
the [crafting
table](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Crafting_Table). Each
leaf yields one sapling.

## Uses

Saplings are used to grow trees. Saplings must be kept in a well lit
area on [dirt](dirt "wikilink") or [grass](grass "wikilink"). Any Spruce
saplings need to be planted in cold [biomes](biomes "wikilink"). Tall
Spruce trees need more humidity than 'normal' spruce trees.

## Notes

  - Tall Spruce Trees have the same wood as Spruce Trees but different
    leaves.
  - Tall Spruce Leaves cannot be made into [Christmas
    trees](Christmas_Tree "wikilink").
  - Saplings, if successfully grown, will consume a block of dirt under
    it and replace it with a "root" - an extra piece of wood.
  - Saplings provide half the fuel value of leaves (0.5 fuel compared to
    leaves' fuel value of 1), so it is wiser to use leaves for fuel
    instead of saplings.
