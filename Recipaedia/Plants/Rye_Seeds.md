## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Seeds are used to plant various types of plants, such as grass, flowers
and rye. Some plants need well tilled, moist and fertilized soil to grow
properly. Otherwise their growth will be stunted and they will not reach
full size.*

## Crafting

Rye seeds are only gained when breaking mature cultivated
[rye](rye "wikilink") (NOT [wild rye](Wild_Rye "wikilink")).

## Uses

Rye seeds main use is to make [flour](flour "wikilink") for
[bread](bread "wikilink").

You can replant the seeds to grow more [rye](rye "wikilink") but it is
better to plant [wild rye seeds](Wild_Rye_Seeds "wikilink").

## Notes
