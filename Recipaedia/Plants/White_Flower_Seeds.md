## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Seeds are used to plant various types of plants, such as flowers, grass
and rye. Some plants need well tilled, moist and fertilized soil to grow
properly. Otherwise their growth will be stunted and they will not reach
full size.*

## Crafting

To obtain White Flower Seeds, place one white flower into a crafting
table. You will get 5 seeds.

[Dirt](../Terrain/Dirt.md "wikilink"), [Soil](../Terrain/Soil.md "wikilink"),
[Sand](../Terrain/Sand.md "wikilink") or [Grass](../Terrain/Grass.md "wikilink") block with the
