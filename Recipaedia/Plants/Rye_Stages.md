__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

This page describes the growing stages of the [Rye](Rye.md "wikilink")
plant. For more details, see the related pages. 

## Description   (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") ) 

''Plant Rye on tilled, moist and fertilized soil to obtain full grown
plants. Harvesting the plants will yield large number of rye seeds. Rye
also grows naturally in form or wild rye. You can obtain wild seeds by
harvesting it. ''

There are several stages of growing Rye, getting lighter in color and
bigger at every stage. 

When [rye seeds](Rye_Seeds.md "wikilink") are first planted, it starts out
the same as any seedling. Each stage gets lighter in color and bigger
until it is fully mature. 

Do not harvest it until it is fully mature. 

## Notes 

[Rye](Rye.md "wikilink") is cultivated to produce [bread](bread "wikilink")
for eating. It will take several game days at a minimum, for rye to
fully mature. See the [Farming](Farming "wikilink") page for information
on proper planting and cultivation of rye. 

The creative inventory only has 3 stages of growing rye.
