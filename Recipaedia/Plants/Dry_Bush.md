## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Dry bushes are commonly found on the edges of deserts or in cold
places. Whenever a plant does not have enough humidity or sunlight ro
sustain itself, it will turn into a dry bush.*

  - They have a rarer larger counterpart called the [large dry
    bush](Large_Dry_Bush.md "wikilink").
