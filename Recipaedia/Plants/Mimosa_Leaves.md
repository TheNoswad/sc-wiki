## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Mimosa leaves grow on mimosa trees and can be used to obtain Mimosa
saplings. They will burn and can be used as a cheap fuel. When placed
away from the trunk, they will decay. Grass traps that can deceive both
man and beast can be crafted from these leaves.*

## Appearance Biomes

Mimosa Trees are found in Chaparrals, Savanna
[Biomes](Biomes "wikilink").

## Uses

They can be used as fuel for the [furnace](furnace "wikilink")Â although
they are very inefficient. This is helpful early in the game.
