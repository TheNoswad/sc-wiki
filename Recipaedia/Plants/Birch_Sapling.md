## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Saplings are used to plant trees. You can obtain them by crafting from
the leaves of trees. When planting, be careful to place the saplings in
a well lit place, full of moisture and of correct temperature. Use
hygrometer and [thermometer](thermometer "wikilink") to measure these
quantities. Oaks like it warm, Birches moderately cool and Spruces cold.
All trees need a lot of humidity. If you plant a sapling in a wrong
spot, it will wilt into a dry brush.*

## Crafting

To obtain Birch Saplings, put Birch Leaves in the [Crafting
Table](Crafting_Table "wikilink"). Each leaf yields one sapling. 

## Uses

Saplings are used to grow trees. Saplings must be kept in a well lit
area on [dirt](dirt "wikilink") blocks. Birch Saplings need to be
planted in warm, semi-humid climates.

## Notes

  - Saplings, if successfully grown, will consume a block of dirt under
    it and replace it will a "root", an extra piece of wood. (Thanks to
    Stanimus for pointing this out)
      - Saplings provide half the fuel value of leaves (.5 fuel compared
        to leaves' fuel value of 1), so it is wise to use leaves for
        fuel instead of saplings.
