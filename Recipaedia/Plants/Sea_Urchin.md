__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Sea Urchins are small, spiny creature that attach themselves to the
seafloor and make a living by filtering nutrients from the seawater.
They are edible but not very tasty or nutritious.*

## Uses

They are edible, however as they have very low nutritional value they
are not very useful to your survival. They can be used as bait for
predators.

## Notes

  - Although sea urchins are technically an animal, the game treats them
    more like a plant and they are even classified as a plant in the
    recipaedia. They are even harvested like a plant, using the axe.
  - You can 'collect' sea urchins like most blocks or plants. You do not
    'kill' them and they do not 'drop' items.
  - Much like [Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink"), they cause little damage to
    nearby animals (or player).
  - They may have different colors, depending where they are.
  - There is a small chance that, if the player consume sea urchins, the
    player will get sick.
