## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Pumpkins are large orange vegetables that grow in groups of 5 to 10
plants. When collected, they can be eaten or crafted into Jack
O'Lanterns.*

## Uses

Pumpkins are mainly used as a food source. They restore 2 hunger points.

They can also be crafted into [Jack O'
Lanterns](Jack_O'_Lantern "wikilink").

They can be crafted into 3 [Pumpkin Seeds](Pumpkin_Seeds.md "wikilink"),
allowing you to farm them.

They can be cooked in a [Furnace](Furnace "wikilink") with a [Water
Bucket](Water_Bucket "wikilink") to make [Pumpkin
Soup](Pumpkin_Soup.md "wikilink").

## Food

The following animals use pumpkins as a food source: [Player's
Character](Character "wikilink"), [Black Bear](Black_Bear "wikilink"),
[Brown Bear](Brown_Bear "wikilink"), [Polar
Bear](Polar_Bear "wikilink"), [Ostrich](Ostrich "wikilink"),
[Wildboar](Wildboar "wikilink"), and [Cassowary](Cassowary "wikilink").

## Farming

Seeds can be acquired when placing a fully grown pumpkin into any
crafting interface. When these seeds are placed on soil, dirt or grass
pumpkins will grow in stages as seen below. If the vines disappear from
the block, this means that the pumpkin has stopped growing and will
remain as an unripe pumpkin. You should pick it and dispose of it to
replant another one. These can still be fed to the animals that will eat
them but you cannot eat them. Pumpkins should be grown without
saltpeter, since planting them will actually destroy the saltpeter.
However, they mature better on soil rather than dirt. 

You will need a large crop if you hope to survive on pumpkins. On
average, 1/3 of planted pumpkins will NOT mature. Another 1/3 is needed
to make seeds for the next crop. So, only about 1/3 of all your plants
will be useful as food and those only restore very little hunger.

## Notes

  - Pumpkins are mostly found in Jungle and
    Forest [Biomes](Biomes "wikilink").
  - Wild boar may often be found near pumpkin patches.
  - They can be placed
    on [Grass](../Terrain/Grass.md "wikilink"), [Dirt](../Terrain/Dirt.md "wikilink") or [Soil](soil "wikilink").
  - Early in the game, it is suggested that you harvest wild pumpkins
    and save some of them, as pumpkins can be very hard to find in other
    biomes that you might settle down on. Convert some pumpkins into
    seeds and plant the seeds on soil. 
  - You can use ripe or unripe to lure animals like Bears or Cassowaries
    into traps and such.
