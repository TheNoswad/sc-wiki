## Description ( From [Recipedia](Recipedia "wikilink") )

*Cotton is a Plant that grow in warm areas. When harvested, provides a
number of cotton wads which can be further processed into cotton
products.*

## Stages

Cotton has to go through 3 phases before it turns into a cotton plant.

The first phase is once you plant it directly. It will look like any
other seed in its first stage (except rye ).

The second phase, the stem grows and tiny cotton balls start to appear.
The Cotton plant will be in this stage for a while.

Finally, It matures into a fully grown cotton plant. Only harvest it
after it's in this stage.
