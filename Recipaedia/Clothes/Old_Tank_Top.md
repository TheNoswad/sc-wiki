## Description ( From [Recipedia](Recipedia "wikilink") )

*Old tank top you wore when being abandoned on this land. Can be dyed.
No protection. Weak insulation*

## Notes

The Old Tank Top can not be crafted. It is on your player at the start
of the game when the ship maroons you. It goes under any shirt.
