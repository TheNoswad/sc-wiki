## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Wearing armor or thick clothing will reduce or even completely
eliminate combat injuries. Armor will absorb the hits, so that they
damage the armor instead of injuring your body. Once the armor receives
too much damage, it will disintegrate.*

*When you are attacked, you will randomly receive a hit into one of your
four body areas: Head, Torso, Legs or Feet. If there is no armor at that
slot, you will receive full injury, irrespective of how much armor you
wear elsewhere. By far the most likely area to receive hits is torso,
followed by legs. Wearing torso armor will stop 60% of hits, torso and
legs together will stop 80%. Head and feet armor is of less importance,
unless you want to be 100% safe.*

*The strongest armor is made of iron and diamonds. Early in the game,
you can craft wooden torso armor from sticks and strings. It's not very
sturdy but will stand a few hits potentially saving your life.*

*Even plain clothes have certain armor value, especially thick ones made
of leather and fur. They do not stop all hits, but only partially reduce
the damage.*

*Wearing heavy armor will make you sink to the bottom and drown, be
careful around deep water.*

## Crafting

Each piece of armor has its own page on this wiki, as listed above. See
those pages to find the crafting recipes and armor specifications. 

## Notes

  - Armor cannot be 'buffed' like tools and weapons can. Once armor is
    used, you cannot upgrade it. Diamond armor must be made from fresh
    Iron armor, etc.

<!-- end list -->

  - Leather clothing also provides a small amount of hit protection.

<!-- end list -->

  - Heavy armor will slow you down. See the individual pages or the
    [Recipedia](Recipedia "wikilink") for this information.

<!-- end list -->

  - Armor for the torso, legs and feet can be worn over other clothing.
    See the [clothingpage](clothing "wikilink") for details. 

<!-- end list -->

  - Chest Plates are the most effective protection because most animals
    attack the player's chest. 60% of all blows given from animals hit
    the chest.

<!-- end list -->

  - Leggings provide protection for the player's legs. 20% of all blows
    given from animals hit the legs.

<!-- end list -->

  - Boots give protection to the player's feet. 10% of all blows given
    from animals hit the feet.

<!-- end list -->

  - Helmets are believed to protect the player's head from flying
    explosion debris, an arrow that bounces back towards the player,
    falling objects, and animals. 10% of all blows given from animals
    hit the head.

<!-- end list -->

  - Iron, diamond, and wooden armor provide very little insulation in
    cold biomes. Only leather and fur [clothing](clothing "wikilink")
    provide significant insulation, with fur giving the most. 

<!-- end list -->

  - You can wear chainmail under iron, diamond, or copper armor.

<!-- end list -->

  - Armor, along with clothing, was released along with the 1.26 update
    in December 2014.

<!-- end list -->

  - When an animal attacks you while you are wearing Copper, Iron or
    Diamond armor, the game makes a 'ting' noise, similar to the sound
    made by hitting iron with a hammer, Also happens with wooden armor
    but the sound that makes wooden armor is the same when breaking
    wooden planks.

<!-- end list -->

  -   - In recent updates the sounds is accompanied with the normal
        attack sound.

<!-- end list -->

  -   - In 2.0, The 'ting' sound is now played when breaking metal
        things (iron blocks, signs, ladders, doors, etc. and copper
        blocks (except for copper wires).
