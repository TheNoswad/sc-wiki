## Description ( From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Old shirt you wore when being abandoned on this land. Can be Dyed. No
Protection. Weak Insulation.*

## Description

When [The Ship](The_Ship "wikilink") maroons the player on the blocky
land of Survival Craft, they start out with ragged and old clothing that
provides minimal protection and warmth. It is advised to never venture
into cold or snowy biomes wearing just the Old Shirt and [Old
Pants](Old_Pants.md "wikilink"), as the player will freeze and soon die.
This can be prevented by wearing [Fur](Fur.md "wikilink") clothing.

## Notes

  - Before 1.26 The old shirts and pants were actually part of your
    skin.
  - As of 1.26, the Old Shirt and [Old Pants](Old_Pants.md "wikilink") can
    be removed, exposing the players new skin of boxer shorts.
