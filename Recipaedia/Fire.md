## Description

Fire is an entity found in Survivalcraft. You can light flammable
blocks/items\* aflame with [matches](Tools/Match.md "wikilink"), [gunpowder
kegs](Items/Gunpowder_Kegs.md "wikilink"), [magma](Terrain/Magma.md "wikilink"), [fire
arrows](Weapons/Fire_Arrows.md "wikilink"), [explosive
bolts](Weapons/Explosive_Bolt.md "wikilink"), and lightning (summoned in [creative
mode](Construction/Mechanics/Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink") only). [Animals](../Bestiary/Animals.md "wikilink")
and the player can be set afire and may die if not extinguished by
[water](Terrain/Water.md "wikilink").

If the animal normally drops meat when killed and dies while afire, the
animal will drop **cooked** meat. If they normally drop
[feathers](Items/Feather.md "wikilink"), [saddles](Items/Saddle.md "wikilink"),
[leather](Items/Leather.md "wikilink"), or [fur](Clothes/Fur.md "wikilink"), these items
burn up and will not be available to the player.Â 

\* Each block/item's individual infobox specifies whether or not it is
flammable.
