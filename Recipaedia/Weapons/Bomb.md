## Use

Select it in the hotbar. Aim and throw it like a stone chunk. After it
lands, a 5 second delay fuse will start then--BOOM\!

## Notes

  - You can start a house or forest fire if used carelessly.
  - Flaming debris can be spread far from the initial explosion.
  - Their explosive power is 50, less than a small gunpowder keg so are
    not very effective against stone and other hard materials.

<!-- end list -->

  - They will scare animals, especially birds, from the area.
  - It can be used to mine hard materials such as stone. However, using
    bombs against stone or blocks with high explosion resistance will
    usually prove ineffective.
  - It is better to use this against soft materials rather than hard
    materials such as stone.
  - Successful mining explosions only drop about 75% of the blocks.
  - Before 2.0 its explosive power was 50
