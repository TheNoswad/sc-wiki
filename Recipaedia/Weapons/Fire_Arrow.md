## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Arrows and [bolts](bolts "wikilink") are fired from projectile
weapons.*

## Crafting

Requires 1 [wooden tip arrow](Wooden_Tip_Arrow.md "wikilink") and 1 [sulfur
chunk](../Minerals/Sulfur_Chunk.md "wikilink"). You get 1 fire arrow.  These arrows may
be made in the [personal crafting interface](Crafting "wikilink").

## Uses

Arrows are shot from a [bow](bow "wikilink"). They are especially good
for killing animals that are hard to melee kill such as birds, or for
when severely injured animals run away so you can land the killing blow.
They are best used on edible animals, like a Wild Boar, to cook their
flesh without cooking it with a furnace. Birds will not drop feathers,
wolves will not drop leather, and bears will not drop their fur, so be
careful what you target. However, if being pursued or if you want to get
rid of dangerous animals, and you do not care about fur or other drops,
than you can shoot the animals and the fire will slowly take health for
a bunch of seconds, or if they enter deep water. The fire will burn
until the target dies/burns up or when if it enters water.

## Notes

  - They will always break.
  - Be careful what you shoot; your house might transform into a
    bonfire.
  - Does not work underwater.
