__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A spear is a versatile weapon that can both be thrown and used for
melee attacks. When used, it will eventually lose its sharpness and
fail. Spears made from better materials will last longer and cause more
damage. Thrown spears will stick in soft materials. It may be hard to
remove a spear that embedded itself too hard.*

## Crafting

Requires 3 [diamonds](../Minerals/Diamond.md "wikilink") and an [iron
spear](Iron_Spear.md "wikilink").

## Notes

  - The spear does not have to be newly made to be coated with diamond.
    You can coat a worn item and it will be as good as new.
  - Spears have a range of up to 21 blocks.
  - This is the most dangerous spear when it bounces back to you as it
    may kill you on one hit.
  - Throwing a spear can trigger targets.
  - To make the most use of the spear is use the [iron
    spear](Iron_Spear.md "wikilink") until it almost breaks and upgrade it
    to the [Diamond Tip Spear](Diamond_Tip_Spear.md "wikilink").
  - You must be level 2 or higher to use Diamond Tip Spear.
