Bolts may be made in the [personal crafting
interface](Crafting "wikilink").

## Uses

Bolts are shot from a [Crossbow](Crossbow.md "wikilink").

Explosive bolts are explosive, as the name implies, so it is not smart
to shoot close-distance objects or animals.

The explosive bolt can be used on large animal crowds, as shooting it in
the middle of them may kill them all, and may cook their meat.

They can also be used as mining tools. It is however, not very efficient
since stone-related materials have high explosion resistance against any
explosives. It is better to mine stone instead of using explosives.

## Notes 

  - The Explosive Bolt does not bounce back at the PC but you can be
    hurt by the explosion. Flaming debris can be thrown in any
    direction. 
  - It cannot be recovered, unlike most projectiles.
