## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A machete is a simple sword like slashing weapon that is very effective
for melee attacks. When used, the machete will gradually lose its
sharpness and eventually fail.Â Machetes made of better materials will
last longer and cause more damage.*

## Crafting

Craft an Iron Machete with one [stick](Stick "wikilink") and two [iron
ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink").

## Notes

  - To make the most use of the machete is use the [Iron
    Machete](Iron_Machete.md "wikilink") until it almost breaks and upgrade
    it to the <strong>[Diamond Edge
    Machete](Diamond_Edge_Machete.md "wikilink")</strong>.
  - The machete does not have to be newly made to be coated with
    diamond. You can coat a worn item and it will be as good as new.
