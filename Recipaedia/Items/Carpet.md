## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Carpet is a decorative material laid on the floor. It can be dyed by
bathing in a paint bucket in a heated furnace*.

## Crafting

Use 9 pieces of canvas. You get 6 white carpet squares.

<div style=" overflow: hidden">

## Notes

  - You can sleep on carpets regardless of what kind of block it is
    placed on.
  - They cannot be placed on 'partial' blocks such as slabs or stairs.
  - Carpets can be *dyed* with all available colors of paint. See the
    [painting](painting "wikilink") page section on dying (not
    painting).
  - You can remove any color the same way with a [Paint
    Stripper](Paint_Stripper "wikilink") bucket.
  - Walking on a carpet-covered block sounds softer and more subdued.
  - Falling rain and snow can **DESTROY** the carpet, unlike running
    water.
  - Carpets make interiors "cosy and nice."
  - Carpet is an air blocker and can prevent heat flow in or out of a
    house.Â 
  - Standing on a carpet will increase your heat bar. This applies even
    if you are outdoors. Great if combined with a campfire. \<verf?\>
  - Colored carpets are available in the item section of the creative
    inventory unlike most dyed or painted blocks.
