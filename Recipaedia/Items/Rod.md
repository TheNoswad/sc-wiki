__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Rods are made by forging iron into shape. They are useful for making
fences, doors, and other things.*

## Crafting 

Rods are forged in a furnace. Two [iron ingots](Iron_Ingot.md "wikilink")
will give you 4 rods. 

## Uses

Iron rods can be used to craft a lot of things. Iron fences, and fence
gates, cell doors, iron signs, crossbow, bolts, musket and musket balls.

They can be used as a melee weapon, with an attack power of 2 and a hit
ratio of 66%. They do not wear down like other weapons, which can come
in handy if you are short on supplies.

## Notes

  - As of the 1.25 update, Iron Rods are forged in a furnace, instead of
    being crafted.

## History

  - 1.24- Added Rod.
  - 1.25 Rods are forged in the furnace instead of being crafted.
