## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Ladders are made from sticks or rods. They make it easy to climb and
descend walls safely. It is safest to climb both up and down facing the
wall. That means you have to approach the ladder backwards when entering
the ladder from the top.*

## Crafting

Requires 7 [sticks](stick "wikilink"). You get 4 ladder pieces.

## Notes

  - Ladders may be used to break a fall. If you place a ladder at the
    bottom of a deep shaft, you can fall down the shaft and the ladder
    will catch you and you won't get any damage.
  - Ladders can ONLY be placed on vertical surfaces. 
  - You can dismount a ladder by facing away from the ladder and
    jumping. 
  - They may be used as decorative elements. 
  - Placing them behind ivy will significantly hide them.
