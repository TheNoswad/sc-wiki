## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Fences are used to enclose areas and prevent animals from going outside
and predators from coming inside. Fence posts can be used as pillars or
furniture elements.*

## <span style="font-size:20px;">Crafting</span>

To craft a wooden fence, 6 [sticks](stick "wikilink") are required. You
get 2 fence pieces. ![Wooden_Fence_craft.png](Wooden_Fence_craft.png

## Notes

  - Wooden fences are NOT secure. The character can easily jump over
    wooden fences. Simply place yourself directly BETWEEN the two posts
    and jumping the fence is very easy\!
  - (This tip provided by viper, on the
    [forum](http://survivalcraft.lefora.com)).
  - Some animals can jump over *any* single fence and as such it is
    recommended to make fences 2 pieces high.
  - [Werewolves](Werewolf "wikilink") can jump 3 blocks high, so make
    sure your fences are tall enough. Werewolves may also attack
    animals.
  - Some animals can still attack the player and/or other animals if
    both the target and the attacker are standing very close to the
    fence.
