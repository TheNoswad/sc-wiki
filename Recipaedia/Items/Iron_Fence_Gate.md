## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Gates are used to make entrances to fenced areas. They can be opened or
closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire, gates will
open or close on the rising edge of a electrical signal. Animals can't
jump a fence gate.*

## Crafting

Craft a fence gate with 2 [Rods](Rod "wikilink") and 4 [Iron
Ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink"). You get 2 gates.
