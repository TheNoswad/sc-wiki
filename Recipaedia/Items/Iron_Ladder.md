The Iron Ladder is a metal version of the Wooden Ladder which is not
flammable and can be used for strong, re-enforced buildings. It is also
thinner than the wooden equivalent, and hangs off the wall instead of
being on the wall.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Ladders are made from sticks or rods. They make it easy to climb and
descend walls safely. It is safest to climb both up and down facing the
wall. That means you have to approach the ladder backwards when entering
the ladder from the top.*

## Crafting

Crafting a ladder requires 7 [rods](rod "wikilink"). You get 4 ladder
pieces.

## History

1.28- Added Iron Ladder.

1.29- New sound effects. \[1\]

## Notes

  - Ladders may be used to break a fall. If you place a ladder at the
    bottom of a deep shaft, you can fall down the shaft and the ladder
    will catch you and you won't get any damage.
  - Ladders can ONLY be placed on vertical surfaces. 
  - You can dismount a ladder by facing away from the ladder and
    jumping. 
  - They may be used as decorative elements. 
  - Placing them behind [ivy](ivy "wikilink") will significantly hide
    them. 
  - The Iron Ladder is not flammable.
  - Best for strong re-enforced buildings.
  - Added in the 1.28 update.
