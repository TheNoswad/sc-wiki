## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A Gunpowder Keg is a sealed, wooden container filled with gunpowder,
with a short fuse attached on the top. The fuse can be lit with a match
or initiated electrically. The keg will explode after several seconds
with a devastating force, destroying blocks and killing any creatures
within the 'blast range'. Certain blocks, such as stone, iron and
diamond are more resilient to explosions than others. Use
[detonators](../Electrics/Electric_Detonator.md "wikilink") to cause an instantaneous
explosion without fuse delay.*

## Crafting

Gunpowder kegs are crafted using [Gunpowder](Gunpowder.md "wikilink") and
[wood planks](../Construction/Planks.md "wikilink").

  - The small keg requires 1 gunpowder and 2 planks.
  - The medium keg requires 2 gunpowders and 4 planks.
  - The large keg requires 3 gunpowders and 6 planks.

## Explosive Force and Damage

The following explanations assume you are playing in Adventure,
Challenging or Cruel mode. All damage is reduced in Harmless mode and
ignored in Creative mode. The Explosive Power of each keg is as listed
in the recipaedia.

The blast range and safe distance were determined by experiments (by
Stanimus).

<span textsize="12">The blast range is the distance where the player is
immediately killed and the safe distance is how close you can stand and
not get hurt by the initial blast. </span>Debris *can* still hit you,
however.

  -
    Keg Size   ---   Power   ---   Blast Range   ---   Safe Distance

<!-- end list -->

  - Small -           60 EP            6 blocks                 8 blocks
  - Medium -     240 EP          10 blocks               12 blocks
  - large -          960 EP          14 blocks               16 blocks

The blast range is a sphere. I.e., 9 blocks from a small keg is safe
when you are straight along a row of blocks and you will be safe if you
circle around the keg at the same effective distance. This applies
vertically as well - a player 9 blocks above a small keg explosion will
also be safe.

<span textsize="12">These numbers are only valid in open-air conditions.
The kegs were exploded over water, which is not affected by the blast.
Explosions inside a cave or tunnel or building will be different. The
explosion calculations take that into account and explosions can be
magnified in enclosed spaces.</span> The numbers do NOT account for you
getting hit by flying or flaming debris, either.

There can be 3 types of damage to the player from an explosion. The
first is the initial blast force which is deadly if you are inside the
blast range. The player may also be hit by flying debris. You can also
be set on fire by flaming, flying debris, which will cause additional
damage over time if you do not douse the fire immediately. Flaming
debris can be thrown as far away as 30 blocks from ANY size keg. If you
place multiple kegs it can throw debris extremely far away\! The bigger
ones will throw more of it.

## Notes

  - Gunpowder kegs are found in the [items](:Category:Items "wikilink")
    section of the [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"), not with the
    [weapons](:Category:Weapons "wikilink").
  - You should never light kegs with a [match](match "wikilink"). The
    keg will likely explode before you can get far enough away unless
    you have a very strong wall to run behind.
  - As of 1.28 Gunpowder kegs can be shot by a
    [Dispenser](Dispenser "wikilink") and will ignite when they are
    launched, so they explode when they land.
  - Bullets fired by Musket and [Fire Arrow](../Weapons/Fire_Arrow.md "wikilink") can
    also be used to ignite a keg.
  - If you're standing at the edge of a block, you might be counted in
    the closer one for damages. Give yourself a bit of extra room, for
    safety. Use 9 blocks instead of 8, for instance.
  - Gunpowder kegs do not block liquids.
  - It is not advisable to use gunpowder kegs to obtain ores as it will
    destroy most rocks and ores. They *are* useful if you simply want to
    clear an area without using up time and your tools.
  - See the [Weaponspage](Weapons "wikilink") for the list of *all*
    weapons (rather than the [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink")
    category).
  - They still explode when dropped as an item. Meaning if a block on
    fire, thrown in magma or thrown into a Campfire and so on, when
    still explode.
  - Using a Gunpowder Keg as a fuel in a [Furnace](Furnace "wikilink"),
    the furnace will explode instantly and possibly kill you\!
