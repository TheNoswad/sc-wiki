## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*An ingot of pure copper. Can be crafted into copper tools, such as
buckets, wires, and other electric devices. Combine multiple ingots to
form a copper block.*

## Crafting

Copper ingot is made by smelting [malachite
chunks](../Minerals/Malachite_Chunk.md "wikilink") in a furnace. You can also obtain
them by dismantling solid [copper
blocks](../Construction/Solid_Copper_Block.md "wikilink").

## Uses

Can be used to craft [Electric Wire](../Electrics/Electric_Wire.md "wikilink"),
[Buckets](../Tools/Bucket.md "wikilink"), [Solid Copper
Blocks](../Construction/Solid_Copper_Block.md "wikilink"), [Batteries](../Electrics/Battery.md "wikilink"),
and other electrical items. As of 1.29 can be used to make amor, tools,
and weapons.

## Notes

  - Do not form them into blocks to hope to save storage space - the
    blocks only stack up to 4 blocks (36 ingots) whereas they can be
    stacked up to 40 in their original form
