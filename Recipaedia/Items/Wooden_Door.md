## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Doors are used to make entrances to buildings. They can be opened and
closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire, doors will
open and close on the rising edge of an electrical signal. Iron or cell
doors cannot be operated when electrically connected.*

## Crafting

To craft a wooden door, you will need 6 wooden planks. This will give
you 1 door.

## Notes

  - The wooden door can still be opened by hand when it's connected to
    to an electric circuit. Other doors cannot. 
  - Animals can poke their head THROUGH any door and attack you, if you
    are close enough to the door.
