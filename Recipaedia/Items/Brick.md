## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Bricks are obtained by firing clay blocks in the furnace. They are the
most versatile building material available, because objects constructed
from bricks can be broken down into the constituent bricks if no longer
needed.*

## Crafting

Bricks are [baked](Furnace "wikilink") from [clay](clay "wikilink"),
each block turning into 2 bricks.

Blocks, stairs and slabs made from bricks may be broken back down to get
the bricks back. Walls and stairs give 2 bricks while slabs give 1, and
as such no bricks are wasted in the process.

## Use

Bricks can be used to make [brick wall](../Construction/Brick_Wall.md "wikilink"), [brick
stairs](../Construction/Brick_Stairs.md "wikilink"), and [brick
slabs](../Construction/Brick_Slab.md "wikilink") using the normal crafting patterns,
however using the brick items instead of blocks. The walls are crafted
in a 2x2 square shape. This means they can be made without out a
crafting table, although one will be needed to make the furnace used in
the process.

## Notes

  - Bricks can be hard to obtain in large quantities because clay is
    most commonly found in the bottom of lakes (where it is hard to dig
    and you get wet) and only so much per lake (usually 20-30 per). Clay
    also spawns on rich quantities under the ocean, although it is
    technically impossible to get them without drowning or becoming a
    shark's meal.
  - Bricks are a thrown item and they cannot be placed. (They can be
    dropped like any other obtainable item.)
  - Bricks are throwable items which can also be compiled into
    construction materials.
