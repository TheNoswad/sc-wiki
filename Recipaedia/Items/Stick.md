## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Sticks are made by cutting planks into pieces. They are a versatile
building material used in the contruction of many items, including
[Torches](Torch.md "wikilink"), [Ladders](Wooden_Ladder.md "wikilink") or
[Fences](Wooden_Fence.md "wikilink"). They can also be used as a last
resort weapon or tool, although their attack power is low.*

## Crafting

Requires 2 [planks](../Construction/Planks.md "wikilink") to make 4 sticks.

## Uses

Sticks are used to craft [Torches](Torch.md "wikilink"), [Wicker
Lamps](Wicker_Lamp "wikilink"), [Ladders](Ladder.md "wikilink"), [wooden
fences](Wooden_Fence.md "wikilink"),
[campfires](Campfire.md "wikilink"), [armor](../Clothes/Wooden_Chest_Plate.md "wikilink"),
[tools](:Category:Tools "wikilink"),
[weapons](:Category:Weapons "wikilink"), [Wooden Chest
Plate](../Clothes/Wooden_Chest_Plate.md "wikilink"), [Wooden
Leggings](../Clothes/Wooden_Leggings.md "wikilink") and many other stuff.

They can also be used as a weapon or tool, but their attack power is
very low, just 1.5, being only slightly better than the bare hand with a
hit ratio of 66%.
