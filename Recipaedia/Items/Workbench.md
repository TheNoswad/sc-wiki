## Description

*Workbench is a piece of workshop furniture made of wood. It is a very
important item, because it allows you to craft items that require more
than 2x2 crafting slots. All craftable items can be made on it, provided
that you have the required materials.*

## Crafting

It is crafted with 4 [Planks](../Construction/Planks.md "wikilink") and can be made in the
personal crafting platform. You get one workbench.

## Notes

  - Since the 1.26 update, the workbench now looks like a real table.
  - Before 2.0, workbench was fluid blocker.
  - Workbenches, chests, furnaces and dispensers all drop what they
    contain when broken or burned.
  - Workbenches are neccesary to make multi state furnitures with more
    than four states, check [this
    page](Advanced_Furniture#Interactive_Furniture "wikilink") for more
    details.
  - Before 2.2, workbench was called crafting table
