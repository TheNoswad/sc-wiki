## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Trapdoors are used to make vertical entrances to buildings. They can be
opened and closed by clicking on them. When connected to a copper wire,
trapdoors will open or close on the rising edge of electric signal. Iron
trapdoors cannot be operated manually when electrically connected. They
can be placed normally or upside=down, depending whether they are
attached to top or bottom side of the block. Upside=down trapdoors will
stop falling blocks.*

## Crafting

To craft a cell trapdoor, you will need 6 [iron
ingots](Iron_Ingot "wikilink"). Put three of them horizontally on the
top row of the crafting table, and the other three on the bottom. This
yields 2 trapdoors.Â

## Notes

  - The cell tap door is a door that can be put horizontally on any
    block. It is an interactive block that can be opened by tapping it.
  - Trapdoors can only be electrically attached from straight across the
    hinges, not above, below, or on the opposite side of the hinges.
