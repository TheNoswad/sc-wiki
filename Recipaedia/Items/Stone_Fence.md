__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Fences are used to enclose areas and prevent animals from going outside
and predators from coming inside. Fence posts can be used as pillars or
furniture elements.*

## Crafting

Requires 6 [granite](granite "wikilink") or
[cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink") in any combination to make 4
fence. The fence has the same texture regardless.

## Notes

  - Unlike other fences, stone fences connect to other blocks
    automatically, including [wooden fence](Wooden_Fence.md "wikilink").
  - They don't have a gate counterpart, although other gates can be used
    in conjunction with them.

<!-- end list -->

  - Stone and [iron fences](iron_fence "wikilink") are more than 1 block
    high and can't be jumped over by the character. Only tigers and
    werewolves can jump over it.
  - Some animals can still attack the player and/or other animals if
    both the target and the attacker are standing very close to the
    fence.
