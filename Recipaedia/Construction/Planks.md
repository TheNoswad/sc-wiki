## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Planks are a versatile construction material that can be obtained by
cutting wood blocks into pieces. A multitude of useful objects, such as
a crafting table or a chest can be made from planks. Planks are
flammable and can be used as a fuel in the furnace.*

## Crafting

Two recipes are available:

You can cut any type wood block to get 4 planks. This can be done from
the [personal crafting interface](Crafting "wikilink"). 

Or dismantle a [wicker lamp](wicker_Lamp "wikilink") in the [crafting
table](Crafting_Table "wikilink") to get 1 plank.

## Notes

  - Planks are usually the very first thing crafted in the game as wood
    is required to make tools and is easy to come by.
  - Planks can be painted using [Paint
    Buckets](Paint_Bucket "wikilink").
