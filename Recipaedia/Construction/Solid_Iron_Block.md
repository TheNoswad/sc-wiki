__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

A block of pure iron. Very heavy and durable. Extremely resilient to
digging and explosions. Can be crafted from multiple iron ingots.

## Crafting

![Solid_Iron_Block_craft.png](Solid_Iron_Block_craft.png
"Solid_Iron_Block_craft.png")Combine 9 [iron
ingots](iron_Ingot "wikilink") to form 1 solid iron block.

The block may be later broken down to retrieve the 9 ingots.

## Use

Iron blocks are primarily used as decoration or building materials.
Their extreme strength provides protection where explosion resistance is
beneficial.

They're also used to craft [Musket](../Weapons/Musket.md "wikilink").

## Notes 

They are found in the CONSTRUCTION section of the recipaedia.

They only stack up to 4, so are not a very efficient means of storing
iron at the equivalent of only 36 ingots per stack.
