## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

Brick Walls can be made by combining several [bricks](Brick "wikilink")
together and binding them with mortar. It is a versatile, strong and
good-looking building material. Brick Walls that are no longer needed
can be recycled into constituent bricks.

## Crafting

It requires 4 [bricks](Brick "wikilink") to craft brick walls. You get 2
walls.

## Notes

  - Brick walls can also be painted in a variety of colours for
    decorative effect.
  - They are not walls like the stone wall, but a cube block like a clay
    block. This means that they are not suitable for a fence
    replacement.
