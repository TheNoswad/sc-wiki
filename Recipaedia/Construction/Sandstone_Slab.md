## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Slabs are half-height blocks, which can be crafted from a variety of
different materials. Thay can be used to cover floors at a cheaper cost
than full size blocks. They can also be used to make long stairs, where
each unit of length moves one up by a half unit of height. Slabs can
also be affixed to the ceilings.*

## Crafting

Requires 3 [sandstone](sandstone "wikilink"). You get 4 slabs.
