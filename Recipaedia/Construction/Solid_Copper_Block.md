## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A block of pure copper. Very heavy and durable. Extremely resilient to
digging and explosions. Can be crafted from multiple copper ingots.*

## Crafting

![Solid_Copper_Block_craft.png](Solid_Copper_Block_craft.png
"Solid_Copper_Block_craft.png")

Combine 9 [copper ingots](copper_Ingot "wikilink") to form 1 solid
copper bock.

The block may be broken down to reclaim the 9 ingots.

## Use

Copper blocks are primarily used as decoration or building materials.
Their extreme strength provides protection where explosion resistance is
beneficial. They are even more resilient to explosions than iron blocks.
Although diamond blocks are even stronger, diamond is flammable so
copper blocks are the best material to make explosion proof areas. It is
the strongest non flammable block besides bedrock.

## Notes

  - They are found in the CONSTRUCTION section of the recipaedia.
  - They only stack up to 4, so are not a very efficient means of
    storing copper at 36 ingots per stack.
