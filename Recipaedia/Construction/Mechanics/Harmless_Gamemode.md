__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

## Description

In Harmless mode almost all danger is removed from the game. The animals
will not attack unprovoked. Falls are less deadly. Health regeneration
is very quick. Digging is 25% faster. It is a good way to learn the
operation of the game without much risk.

## Gameplay Features

  - You have to work to get
    [blocks](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Blocks),
    and craft
    [items](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Items),
    etc.
  - Mine blocks more quickly than in [Cruel](Cruel_Gamemode.md "wikilink"),
    [Adventure](Adventure_Gamemode.md "wikilink"), and
    [Challenging](Challenging_Gamemode.md "wikilink").
  - Being on fire, freezing, etc. can still affect players
    [health](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Health_and_Damage_System)
    but you do not die from freezing.
  - [Animals](:Category:Animals "wikilink") are only provoked when hurt.
    They do not attack for no reason.
  - Sleep is still necessary every 2 days.
  - [Tools](:Category:Tools "wikilink") and
    [Weapons](:Category:Weapons "wikilink") eventually wear down and
    eventually break.
  - No animal [spawn
    eggs](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs) aside
    from birds are avaliable.
  - You do not use up stamina.

## Notes

  - See [World Options](World_Options "wikilink") to learn how to change
    the game mode.
  - It is the recommended gamemode for [new
    players](../../../Guides/Beginner's_Guide.md "wikilink") as it is the easiest survival
    style mode.
  - You are unable to edit [world options](World_Options "wikilink")
    other than your texture pack and skin while the world is set to
    harmless mode.
