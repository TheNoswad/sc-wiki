![Farming](Farming.md "Farming") ![Therer.png](Therer.png "Therer.png")
Farming can be used to grow various plants. As of 1.26, there are two
plants you can use for food - rye to make bread and pumpkins. But you
can farm several other plants as well like cotton, ivy, cacti, trees,
flowers and tallgrasses.

Farming works best on [tilled soil](../../Terrain/Soil.md "wikilink") that is placed next
to or on top of water, and is fertilized with
[saltpeter](../../Minerals/Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink"). This is called cultivated soil.
Different trees grow in different ranges of temperature and humidity,
the rest of the plants don't care. Rye and cotton grow best in moist,
cultivated soil.

## Crop Types

[Rye](../../Plants/Rye.md "wikilink") can be made into [flour](flour "wikilink"),
[dough](dough "wikilink") and [bread](bread "wikilink"). Rye seeds can
be obtained by uprooting it's wild counterpart, which when planted in a
good enough environment will grow into yellow edible rye.

[Pumpkin seeds](../../Plants/Pumpkin_Seeds.md "wikilink") can be removed from pumpkins
by putting one in a crafting slot, and planted on high quality soil. The
grown pumpkins may be eaten raw, but can also be cooked in a furnace
with a water bucket to get pumpkin soup.

[Cotton](../../Plants/Cotton.md "wikilink") can be grown to produce [Cotton
Wads](../../Plants/Cotton_Wad.md "wikilink") which are used to make
[canvas](canvas "wikilink") and is also used when loading a
[musket](musket "wikilink"). Cotton seeds may be obtained by breaking
wild cotton plants. They must then be planted on proper soil to grow
into cultivated cotton plants.

[Ivy](../../Plants/Ivy.md "wikilink") is used for string, but can only be planted on
vertical surfaces. Ivy is grown from harvested ivy and not from seeds.
It does not need dirt or soil to grow. The best way to farm it is to use
a wall and put the ivy as far up as you can reach. It will grow down
quickly (depending on the environment) and you can harvest it. Be sure
to leave the top ivy block on the wall so it will continue to spread.  

Trees do not need watered or fertilized soil but they must have enough
humidity and the right temperature range for the species. Saplings may
be crafted from the leaves of the tree and planted. They will grow over
time and can be harvested for wood and leaves.

[Flowers](../../Plants/Red_Flower.md "wikilink") can be used for decoration. You get
flower seeds from flowers, using the personal crafting interface or
crafting table. They can be grown on soil, dirt or sand and fertilizer
is not necessary.

[Cacti](../../Plants/Cactus.md "wikilink") can be grown on sand up to 3 blocks tall. If
they are cut leaving the bottom portion, they will regrow their loss.
There are no seeds and the cactus block itself is planted to grow
taller.

[Tall Grass](../../Plants/Tall_Grass.md "wikilink") seeds can be obtained by putting a
tall grass into the personal crafting interface or the crafting table.
Tall grass can be grown in the same conditions as flowers.

## Farm Preparation

1.  You will want to choose a good location for your farm. This will
    depend on what you are farming. Trees need a humid environment, and
    the right temperature range. A [thermometer](thermometer "wikilink")
    and [hygrometer](hygrometer "wikilink") are very helpful to
    determine a good location, especially for trees. Other crops aren't
    affected as much by the environment except crops that need to be
    irrigated by water since if it's too cold the water can freeze and
    the soil will dry up. Also if you haven't found [malachite
    ore](Malachite_Block "wikilink") yet in order to make a
    [Bucket](../../Tools/Bucket.md "wikilink") you'll need to place your farm next to
    water in order to irrigate the soil. Also plants need light to grow
    (a block 1 higher than the plant must have lighting \>= 9, \>= 12 if
    cacti, any if ivy), so outdoors is better. You can also add some
    torches or lamps and make them grow even faster.  \< NOTE: See the
    [thermometer page](../../Tools/Thermometer.md "wikilink") for information on bug
    when holding it. \>
2.  Once you have a good spot, you should lay out the area you wish to
    plant, especially with crops that need tilled soil such as
    [rye](rye "wikilink"), [pumpkin](pumpkin "wikilink") or
    [cotton](cotton "wikilink"). A large farm will sustain you and often
    smaller farms will not suffice. For example, it takes a lot of rye
    to make a little bread and due to the slow growing time it is only
    really efficient when grown in large quantities.
      - Crops and tilled soil can be ruined by you or animals walking on
        it, so it's important to protect your crops with a fence, spiked
        planks, lava, etc., or placed up high, like on top of your
        house. They may even be built indoors or underground. When
        laying out the plan for your farm, something to consider is how
        you will access the crops without damaging them. Creating raised
        walkways if you do not wish to risk becoming wet by walking
        towards them through placed water is quite sensible and reduces
        the time spent afterwards in which you would have to become dry
        again. A double high fence is strongly recommended since some
        animals can jump two block high.
        [Werewolves](Werewolf "wikilink") and [tigers](Tiger "wikilink")
        are able to jump over double fences so if you are in an area
        prone to them, you may wish to build your fence three high and
        add a roof. You could also use a sand block and cacti on it
        which will grow and give you a 3+1 block high spiked wall which
        will keep animals away.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Once the area is ready, you must lay out your plots. The best way is
    to have a row of water next to every three rows of plants. Also in
    order to save [saltpeter](../../Minerals/Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink") it's a good
    idea to make the plots not only three rows wide, but also three rows
    long, or in lengths that are multiples of three (6, 9, 12). When
    placing water, dig a trench at least one block deep into the ground
    right next to your soil and then add water. Don't try to put water
    on top of the soil and plants because it will wash them away and
    ruin them.
2.  Use water on the grass before using the rake as this will convert
    the grass to dirt and saves your rake's life. Get a rake and till
    every block that you wish to plant on. Tilled
    [dirt](dirt "wikilink") becomes [soil](soil "wikilink") and has a
    grooved look to it. It will also become darker in color as it
    becomes moist due to the water.
3.  Get your fertilizer - [saltpeter](../../Minerals/Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink"), and
    break it on the soil by tapping the soil (don't throw the
    saltpetre.) It will spread to a block on each side of it,
    fertilizing up to 9 squares per chunk. (Which is why it's best to
    farm on plots that are 3x3 in size.) Fertilized soil has specks of
    white on top of it.
4.  Once your farm is fenced in and the soil is tilled, irrigated and
    fertilized you can now sow your seeds. Be careful not to step on
    your soil after planting the seeds\! Note that fertilized soil
    doesn't last forever. (This actually makes rye farming a
    NON-sustainable method of survival since saltpetre is NOT
    replenishable.) However, you can get up to three harvests per block
    of fertilized soil.
5.  Once your seeds are in the soil, walk away and leave it to grow.
    Different crops take different amounts of time to grow, cotton being
    the quickest.
6.  When the crop is ready, harvest it by breaking the plants. If you
    made your plots on 3x3 blocks you'll have to walk on the soil to
    collect the crops(Or you can place some rotten pumpkin on the soil
    and walk on it and take it back after use) Just rake it right away
    so it'll continue to be fertilized moist soil. If you have lots of
    [saltpeter](../../Minerals/Saltpeter_Chunk.md "wikilink") and hate raking then you can
    make your plots in rows of one or two blocks and just not step on
    the soil when harvesting.
7.  You can take some of the harvested plant and use it to create more
    seeds for the next crop. You can do this with rye, but it is not
    recommended since it takes so much rye to make bread you will want
    to keep every rye seed you harvest, to make bread. Wild rye seeds
    can be collected as you wander through the world. However, if you're
    not pressed for food, go ahead and replant your harvested rye seeds.
    With pumpkins ,you have no other choice but to sacrifice some
    pumpkins to make more seeds.

## Crop-specific Notes

[Rye](../../Plants/Rye.md "wikilink") can be very picky and may not grow well even in
the best prepared soil. It can take a long time to grow and may produce
few seeds per plant. It takes 9 seeds to make *one* bread. If you use
harvested seeds to grow the next crop, you may only get one seed per
plant to make into bread. That means you may need 9 plants for each loaf
plus one saltpeter. This is a very inefficient use of resources. It is
very helpful to gather seeds from wild rye.

[Cotton](../../Plants/Cotton.md "wikilink") will grow fast compared to rye. It is
usually fully grown in two to three SC days. When it is harvested, you
get cotton wads *plus* more cotton seeds. You do not need the seeds to
craft anything, so they can be collected to plant the next crop. If you
do not have extra cotton seeds, they can easily be gathered from wild
cotton plants. Also cotton don't need fertilized soil. Just plant them
on tilled soil close to water and you won't need to walk naked anymore.

[Pumpkins](../../Plants/Pumpkin.md "wikilink") can be picked and eaten once they are
ripe. Pumpkins will grow to maturity even on grass, but they grow better
on cultivated, moist soil so planting them just anywhere may not get the
best results. Planting pumpkins on fertilized soil completely destroys
the fertilizer. Harvested mature pumpkins can be crafted to get more
seeds. One pumpkin will make three seeds so you can eat (or use) two
*other* pumpkins and still have seeds for the next crop. If you plan on
growing pumpkins, you should NOT eat the first few pumpkins you find as
they may be scarce to find. As of update 2.1 pumpkins can't survive more
than 2 in-game days after fully mature, because pumpkins will rot, and
both rotten unripe pumpkins or ripe pumpkins cannot be used to craft
pumpkins seed, so you must check your pumpkins crop often, and don't
leave your pumpkins crop for relative long time, because some or even
all of your pumpkins will be rot.

Trees can be grown indoors if there is enough space. They grow only on
Dirt and Grass. No block other than soil can be fertilized\! A water on
the bottom blocks of the 3x3 square around a sapling raises its
temperature and sets humidity \>= 12.
