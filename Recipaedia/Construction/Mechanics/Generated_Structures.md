## Caves

### Granite Caves

These caves are mostly composed of [dirt,](../../Terrain/Dirt.md "wikilink") gravel, and
[granite](granite "wikilink") near the top,
[granite](granite "wikilink") , [iron ore](../../Minerals/Iron_Ore.md "wikilink") , and
[coal ore](../../Minerals/Coal_Ore.md "wikilink") towards the middle,
and[basalt](../../Terrain/Basalt.md "wikilink") , [diamond ore](../../Minerals/Diamond_Ore.md "wikilink") ,
and other ores deeper in. Although they spawn in all biomes, you will
mostly find them near mountains. Veins of all ores are found in caves.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Cave.jpg](Cave.jpg "Cave.jpg")

</div>

### Sand Caves

These caves are mostly composed of sand near the top, sandstone and
saltpeter ore in the middle, and basalt and other ores deeper in. These
spawn exclusively in deserts, and will collapse if you irritate the
sand. So be careful where you place torches\!

</div>

## Bodies of Water

### Pools

Pools are small bodies of water, only 1-2 blocks deep. Most commonly
found in deserts and jungles. Sand and dirt will be found in the bottom.
Freshwater bass and rays can be found in pools.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-26-51.jpg](Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-26-51.jpg
"Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-26-51.jpg")

</div>

### Lakes

Lakes are deeper then pools, but more shallow bodies of water then
oceans. You will commonly find [sand](sand "wikilink")
,[dirt](../../Terrain/Dirt.md "wikilink") , and [clay](clay "wikilink") in the bottom. In
lush, humid areas, [piranhas](Piranha "wikilink") will be found. In
other lakes, you can find bass and rays. They are found in all biomes,
but most commonly in forests and jungles.

<div style=" overflow: hidden ">

![Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-33-40.jpg](Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-33-40.jpg
"Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-33-40.jpg")

</div>

### Ocean

Oceans are deep bodies of water in Survival Craft found off of the shore
where you are first abandoned when you start a new world. They can
contain[islands](Islands "wikilink") and have certain animals living in
them. [Orcas](Orca "wikilink"), [sharks](../../../Bestiary/Shark.md "wikilink"), rays, bass,
and[piranhas](Piranha "wikilink") all call the ocean home.

</div>

## Graves

Graves are most commonly (80%) found 1-5 at a time, but occasionally
(20%) you will find a graveyard consisting of 6-20 graves. If you dig up
the graves, you can find items such as: [wicker
lamps](../../Items/Wicker_Lamp.md "wikilink"), [torches](../../Items/Torch.md "wikilink"),
[saddles](../../Items/Saddle.md "wikilink"), diamond tools, etc. You can find the
complete list on page [Treasure
Generator](Treasure_Generator "wikilink").

### On Grass

Graves on grass will have a grey/slate colored appearance. The same as
cobblestone and granite.

</div>

### On Sand

On sand, graves have a more rustic, grey-brown color. This behavior has
not been observed in other blocks.

"Survivalcraft_2019-12-26_15-21-09.jpg")

</div>

## Traps

Grasspits are found most commonly in wastelands and snowy habitats. They
can be 3 to 5 blocks deep, 2 to 5 blocks long, 2 to 5 blocks wide and
are completely covered by [Grass Traps](../../Items/Grass_Trap.md "wikilink"). A half
of them have [spiked planks](../../Items/Spiked_Plank.md "wikilink") on the bottom, a
third of which are activated. They are hard to spot, as they can have
[flowers](../../Plants/Red_Flower.md "wikilink"), [pumpkins](../../Plants/Pumpkin.md "wikilink"), etc.
growing on top of them and blend with the [grass](grass "wikilink") very
well.

## Pockets and minerals

| Cluster block name | Altitde   | Only in            |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| Dirt               | 50 to 100 | Granite            |
| Gravel             | 20 to 80  | Granite            |
| Limestone          | 20 to 120 | Granite            |
| Clay               | 50 to 70  | Granite            |
| Sand               | 40 to 80  | Sandstone          |
| Basalt             | 20 to 60  | Granite, Sandstone |
| Granite            | 4 to 50   | Basalt             |
| Water              | 40 to 60  | Any                |
| Magma              | 15 to 43  | Any                |
| Coal Ore           | 5 to 200  | Granite            |
| Copper Ore         | 20 to 65  | Granite            |
| Iron Ore           | 2 to 40   | Basalt             |
| Saltpeter Ore      | 50 to 90  | Sandstone          |
| Sulphur Ore        | 2 to 40   | Basalt             |
| Diamond Ore        | 2 to 15   | Basalt             |
| Germanium Ore      | 2 to 50   | Basalt             |

Magma pools usually generate in the basalt layer. They can also
intersect with caves. Magma pools are usually up to 10 by 10 blocks, and
can be anything up to 3-4 blocks deep. They can be dangerous when
mining, so watch out\!

## Notes

  - Every tree in SurvivalCraft are 4 years old. Just count how many
    rings to see its age.
  - Clay and limestone are commonly found in lakes.
  - From 1.23 flat worlds have an option to generate a magma oceans.
  - Traps sometimes has inactivated spikes although the trap has no
    electricity.
  - Cave and grave generation has impossible block placement.
  - Magma pools generate in oceans.
  - More water, magma and ores seem to be generated near the mountains.

\*Chance of finding a coal block in a vein = 1 / 16.
