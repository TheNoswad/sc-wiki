This article covers the in-game settings menus and controls. These are
the settings in version 2.1. The section on [control
settings](Game_Settings.md#Control_Settings "wikilink") is usually the only
part used.

-----

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![Settings_Categories.png](Settings_Categories.png
"Settings_Categories.png") When you open the SETTINGS menu, you are
presented with this screen showing the different categories of settings.
These categories and settings are explained below.

</div>

## Performance Settings

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![Performance_Settings.png](Performance_Settings.png
"Performance_Settings.png") These settings are usually set automatically
for the best performance on your device. They will affect how smoothly
the game runs. If you have problems with the game lagging or locking up
or crashing, these settings may need to be turned down.

</div>

### Screen Resolution

  -
    You can reduce the display resolution to cut the processor power
    required.

### [Visibility Range](View_Distance "wikilink")

  -
    A higher range lets you see clearly farther away but uses more
    processor power. It also affects the range of electric circuits and
    animal spawning. The game will make suggestions when you change this
    value. If your system does not meet these suggestions, you may
    experience lagging or other problems. It ranges from 32 blocks to
    320 blocks since version 2.1. 

### Camera View Angle

  -
    Choose Narrow, Normal or Wide. Wide will show more on the display at
    once but it will be more distorted and requires more processing
    power. 

### Terrain Mipmaps

  -
    Enabling this setting allows the game to use lower resolutions in
    certain circumstances while drawing the landscape. This can speed up
    drawing the screen.

### Sky Rendering Mode

  -
    **Full** = Detailed sky with visible sun, moon and stars and also
    visible clouds.
    **NoClouds** = Detailed sky with visible sun, moon and stars, absent
    clouds.
    **Disabled** = The sky appears with uniform color.

### Object Shadows

  -
    Certain objects like animals and dropped items cast shadows. Disable
    for no shadows and possibly, lag reduction.

### Framerate Limit

  -
    Use this to lower the maximum screen redraw rate. Reducing this rate
    may help with lagging problems but could make motion look choppy.

There are 3 settings on this control: "2 vsync", "1 vsync" and
"Unlimited".

### Display FPS Counter

  -
    Enabling this will show the current Frames Per Second that the game
    is drawing the screen at. It can be used to see if something is
    slowing it down. 

### Display FPS Ribbon

  -
    Enabling this will show a sliding graph across the bottom of the
    screen. This graph shows the current FPS rate and can be used to see
    if some actions are slowing the game down.

## Graphics Settings

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![Graphics_Settings.png](Graphics_Settings.png "Graphics_Settings.png")
The only setting on this page is for the dark areas brightness. Change
this setting to make the screen brighter when there is little lighting
in the game. This is often considered 'cheating' as you may see in the
dark without using a torch.

</div>

## User Interface Settings

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![UI_Settings.png](UI_Settings.png "UI_Settings.png") These settings
alter the Graphical User Interface size and appearance, control what is
shown in the screenshots and turns on/off access to the Community
Content. The control sensitivities are included in this section as well.

</div>

### UI Size

  -
    This sets the size of the onscreen buttons and pads. 

### UI Vertical Flip

  -
    Flips all on-screen controls upside-down, for multiplayer
    compatibility. Flips the helps screens and all other user interface
    screens as well.

### Hide Move/Look Pads

  -
    The pads at the bottom of the screen may be hidden by this setting. 

### Show UI in Screenshots

  -
    Disable this to hide the buttons and pads in any screenshot. 

### Show Logo in Screenshots

  -
    Disable this to hide the logo in any screenshot. 

### Screenshot Resolution

  -
    This setting lets you take your screenshots in either fullHD
    resolution, or at the game's current screen resolution.

### Community Content

  -
    You can control access to the Community Content with this setting. 

**Diabled** prevents any access to the CC.

**Strict** only shows the whitelisted CC content, suitable for young
children.

**Normal** allows all moderated content to be shown.

**Show ALL** will display all submitted CC content, including
unmoderated content.

## Audio Settings

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![Audio_Settings.png](Audio_Settings.png "Audio_Settings.png") You can
change the overall volume level of the sound sources in the game.

</div>

### Sounds Volume

  -
    Adjusts the loudness of all the sounds made in the game.

### Music Volume

  -
    Adjusts the loudness of the background music.

## Controls Settings

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![Control_Settings.png](Control_Settings.png "Control_Settings.png")
These change certain aspects of the controls the player uses during the
game.

</div>

### Touchscreen Move Control

  -
    **Buttons**. This makes the move control a keyboard-type layout.
    There are 5 buttons and they are even labelled like a keyboard, 'W'
    'A' 'S' 'D' plus an unlabelled button in the center. The labelled
    buttons move the hero in the indicated direction - forward, left,
    right and backward. The center button makes him jump. He always
    moves at the same speed with these controls.

This mode is very effective in [creative
mode](Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink"). If you are flying and place your
finger in the center then move it up or down, the hero will move
vertically *only* and this is helpful when building.

  -
    **Touchpad**. This just shows a single touchpad. You move by placing
    your finger in this pad and moving it in the direction you wish the
    character to move. The farther you move your finger, the faster he
    will move. You can also move in any direction unlike with the
    buttons layout.

### Touchscreen Look Control

  -
    **Fullscreen** lets you swipe anywhere on the screen to look around.
    To activate an object or break a block, you touch that block or
    object. To place a block, you tap where you want it.
    **Split Touch** still uses the whole screen to look around. But you
    must have the center cursor on an object or block to activate/break
    it. You must orient the cursor where you want to place a block. Then
    you tap/hold anywhere on the screen to activate/break/place the
    block or object.
    **Touchpad Only**. You must start swiping from within the LOOK pad
    or the view will not move.

### Left Handed Layout

  -
    This will swap the controls left-to-right for easier use by
    left-handed people. This article assumes it is NOT enabled.

### Flip Vertical Axis

  -
    When looking up-and-down, you can 'invert' the controls so that when
    you swipe up the character actually looks down. This is useful for
    some people and depends on how you expect the view to react.

### Auto Jump

  -
    When the character walks up to a full block, he will jump onto that
    block automatically if this is set. If it is not, you will have to
    tap the screen to make him jump.

(Sensitivity Settings) These settings will affect how 'touchy' the
controls are and may need to be set for the different player's style of
play.

### Move Sensitivity

  -
    Changing this affects how you move the hero. With a higher value,
    you don't swipe your finger as far to make him run. However it will
    be harder to make him move slowly.

### Look Sensitivity

  -
    Increasing this value makes it so you can look around quicker when
    you swipe. Deceasing means you have to swipe more to make him look.
    Be careful however, as making this too high or low can seriously
    effect your gameplay\!

### Gamepad Cursor Speed

  -
    Adjusts how the game responds to changes from the connected gamepad.
    Increase to have more sensitivity.

### Gamepad Dead Zone

  -
    Adjusts how much the 'joystck' must be moved before the game starts
    reacting. Used to avoid "jitters" when the control is not being
    moved.

### [Creative Mode](Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink") Dig Speed

  -
    This affects how fast you can mine blocks in [Creative
    mode](Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink"). Increasing the value means you
    will mine faster. Contrary, decreasing slows your mining speed.
    Adjustable between 100 and 300 mS.

### [Creative mode](Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink") Reach

  -
    This lets you adjust how far from the character you can
    tap/break/place blocks. Adjustable from 5.0 to 10.0 blocks, in 0.5
    block increments.

### Minimum Hold Duration

  -
    This is used to change how long you must 'hold' after you press, in
    order to use the 'tap-and-hold' action such as breaking a block.
    Another tap-and-hold action is splitting the items in a stack.
    Increasing this value means you have to hold longer before the block
    starts to break, while lowering it does the opposite.

### Minimum Drag Distance

  -
    When you put your finger on the screen to tap, it will not stay
    exactly still. This setting governs how far your finger must move
    before it is considered a drag rather than a tap. If your taps
    register as drags, increase this and vice versa.

## Compatibility Settings

"Use these setting only if you experience issues with the game."

<div style="overflow: hidden">

![Compatibility_Settings.png](Compatibility_Settings.png
"Compatibility_Settings.png") The settings in this screen are only used
when there are specific problems with the game. You should not change
them unless you have these problems. It will also show the game log,
which may be useful for diagnosing problems.

</div>

### Single-threaded Terrain Update

  -
    "Enable this to force the game to use a single thread only when
    updating the terrain. It will make the game run slower on multicore
    devices, but might make it slightly faster on single core ones."

### Use Audio Track Caching

  -
    "Enable this if you experience issues with audio and have Android
    4.3 or earlier. This setting reduces the number of AudioTrack
    objects created."

### Use Reduced Z-Range

  -
    "Enable this if you experience issues with graphics like invisible
    parts of the world near the player or garbled textures. It reduces
    the clipspace Z range from -1/1 to 0/1 as some Android devices have
    depth buffering and clipping issues with the full range."

### View Game Log

  -
    This shows the 'log' for all the events that happen in the game. It
    may be viewed by the technically minded to see if there's problems
    within the game.

### Reset to Defaults

  -
    This will change all the above settings to the factory defaults.
