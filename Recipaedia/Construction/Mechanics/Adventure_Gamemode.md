## Description

Adventure mode is for players who want to create quest maps and share
them with others. In this mode you cannot dig without tools. Create your
quest map in [Creative Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") and
change it to Adventure Mode before uploading.

## Gameplay Features

  - Finite supply of
    [blocks](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Blocks),
    [items](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Items),
    etc.
  - Being on fire, freezing, etc. affects players
    [health](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Health_and_Damage_System).
  - [Animals](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Animals)
    are provoked more easily than in [Harmless
    mode](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Harmless_Gamemode).
  - Sleep is necessary every 2 days.
  - [Tools](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Tools) and
    [Weapons](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Weapons)
    wear down and eventually break.
  - No animal [spawn
    eggs](http://survivalcraftgame.wikia.com/wiki/Creative_Eggs) are
    avaliable.
  - Cannot dig, mine, etc. wihout proper tools.

## Notes

  - See [World Options](World_Options "wikilink") to learn how to change
    the game mode.
  - While the world is set to [Creative
    Gamemode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink"), you are able to enable an
    option called "Disable Adventure Survival Mechanics". This makes it
    so that in Adventure Mode you do not have depleting hunger, stamina
    does not go down etc. This feature may be useful for parkour maps.
  - You are also able to disable "Adventure Respawn" where when a player
    dies in Adventure Mode, they must restart their world from the
    beginning.
