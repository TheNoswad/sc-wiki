__NOEDITSECTION__

Crafting is essential to survival. All tools, weapons and most building
materials are made through crafting.

This page covers the general crafting process, not specific crafting
recipes. <u>All available recipes can be found in the
[recipaedia](recipaedia "wikilink"), through the in-game help.</u> You
can search for any individual item and its recipe on this wiki by using
the SEARCH bar at the top of every page.

## Description (From [Recipaedia](../.. "wikilink"))

*Crafting is a process of making more complicated items out of simpler
ones, using a crafting table or the crafting area.*

*To craft, you need to place ingredients in the crafting slots in a
pattern specific to the item being crafted. All crafting recipes are
available in RECIPAEDIA.*

*![Recipaedia_1.PNG](Recipaedia_1.PNG "Recipaedia_1.PNG")*

![Recipaedia_2.PNG](Recipaedia_2.PNG "Recipaedia_2.PNG")

*There are two sizes of crafting areas: 2x2 and 3x3. The smaller area is
always available and can be accessed by pressing the crafting button. To
craft more complicated items on a 3x3 area you need to make a crafting
table, place it somewhere in the world and click on it.*

You open the personal crafting area by touching the crafting button on
the screen. This is the button with the four squares. See the [GUI
page](Onscreen_Buttons/GUI "wikilink") for more information. You open
the [crafting table](../../Items/Crafting_Table.md "wikilink") by tapping on it when
you are close enough. The crafting window is similar for both. See the
pictures below.

The crafting window has two major spaces in it. The left side is the
crafting section. The crafting grid is on the top and is either 2x2 or
3x3. The output box is under that. The right side of the window shows
your inventory. Drag the materials you need from your inventory onto the
specified spaces in the crafting grid.

**Be aware that when you are using either crafting area, the game IS NOT
PAUSED. You can still be attacked while crafting, so make sure you are
in a safe place BEFORE crafting.**

## Crafting Process

The process for crafting is the same for either crafting area size. Most
of the items you need will have to be made on the workbench, in the 3x3
area.

1.  Find the item you wish to craft in the
    [recipaedia](recipaedia "wikilink").
2.  Look at the materials needed and the pattern they have to be in. You
    must have all the materials in your
    [inventory](Onscreen_Buttons/GUI "wikilink").
3.  Exit the recipaedia and return to gameplay.
4.  Open the [crafting table](../../Items/Crafting_Table.md "wikilink") or the
    handcrafting grid and place the specified materials in the pattern
    shown in the recipaedia.
5.  When the pattern is correct, your item will appear at the bottom of
    the crafting window. Drag the item into your inventory to accept it.
    You can rearrange all the materials at will before you remove the
    finished product.
6.  Close the crafting window by tapping the crafting button on the left
    of the screen. If you close the window before removing the finished
    product, all materials will stay in the crafting table or the
    personal crafting grid.

## 2x2 Crafting

The 2x2 crafting area is also called handcrafting because you do not
need a [workbench](workbench "wikilink") to use it. You can only make
rather simple items like [sticks](../../Items/Stick.md "wikilink"), [wooden
planks](../Planks.md "wikilink"), [crafting
tables](../../Items/Crafting_Table.md "wikilink"), etc.

If your inventory is full, you can even use the 4 slots in the personal
crafting area as additional storage. However, you will NOT be able to
craft anything here until you remove the stored items from the crafting
slots.

Below is an example of the 2x2 crafting table, being used to make a
Workbench:

## Multi-State Furniture

Crafting is also used to make multi-state furniture. Put two or more
furniture in the crafting area in the desired order to make a
multi-state furniture. You can also made multi-state connected
furniture, furniture buttons and furniture switches. Check
[Furniture](Furniture "wikilink") and [Advanced
Furniture](Advanced_Furniture "wikilink") pages for more details.
