FPS meter is a feature added in 1.26. It gives the framerate speed, CPU
percentage and more. This is helpful for users that want to know
Survival Craft's performance on their device. If the framerate is low
then look at the CPU usage percentage. If it is high then turn down
[view distance](View_Distance "wikilink") . If it is low then turn down
screen resolution. These options can be found in performance settings.
