## Description

If a community content world is offensive, you can report it. This
feature is a part of the rating system, added in the 1.23 update. There
are various ways you can report things. Reporting doesn't go too far as
it can't really ban you from making worlds on the community content, but
if enough reports are made, the world will be removed from communtiy
content.

## How To Report

One way you can report offensive content is by going into the paused
menu while IN THE WORLD, tap rate, select the world, and tap the
offensive content button right below the stars.

## Reporting Ticks

These are the following ticks that you can use when reporting. You can
only use one tick at a time.

Racism

Sex/Nudity

Hate speech

Excessive swearing

Dating

Plagiarism

Drugs/Alchohol

Cruelty

Other (If the report you want isn't on the list.)
