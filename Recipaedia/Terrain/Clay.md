## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Clay is a heavy, densely packed soil made of very small grains. From
time immemorial it was known that by firing it in a furnace one can
obtain bricks, which are the most versatile building material. Clay is
often found on the bottoms of shallow lakes. Can be painted.*

## Uses

Clay can be smelted to produce [bricks](Brick "wikilink").

It's very suitable for decorative purposes, especially (as of 2.0)
because it allows for solid color when painted, unlike granite and other
materials. It is also considered by some the best material to use when
constructing furniture, because of its purity of color.

## Notes

  - Beginning in V2.0 clay is now [paintable.](Painting "wikilink")
  - Clay may also be found underground, and in caves. It is also very
    common at the bottom of the ocean and in ponds and lakes. Getting
    clay from the ocean however, can be hard because of predators and
    oxygen levels.
  - Projectiles will always stick into this block.
