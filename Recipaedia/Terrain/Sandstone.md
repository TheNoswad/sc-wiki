## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A brittle yellow stone often found under dry, sandy areas. It can
easely be quarried with a pickaxe, and because of its brittleness even
with bare hands. It may contain saltpeter ore, which is found in
shallow, flat veins in places where in the ancient times birds nested
and covered the ground with their nitrogen rich droppings.* Sandstone is
only obtained by breaking the blocks. 

## Uses

  - Sandstone can be made into [stairs](Sandstone_Stairs "wikilink") and
    [slabs](Sandstone_Slab "wikilink").
  - It is a very bright block and will keep hallways brighter with fewer
    lights.
