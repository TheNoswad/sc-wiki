## Description

Magma is a block in Survivalcraft that is unobtainable. Despite being
able to transport and obtain into [buckets](../Tools/Bucket.md "wikilink"), it is
not the original block. Magma is really risky when going underground.
Magma spawns in pools of granite or basalt but more commonly basalt. It
is a really bad idea to pour magma in your house as it can kill you in
almost 3 seconds. It will also destroy a lot of your items.

## Notes

  - Before the Alpha 1.11 update, magma did not make fire due to fire
    not existing in game.
  - Magma was added in the 1.8 update along with buckets (to put it in)
  - You can Lose air in Magma. Although it's almost invisible to see
    without creative mode due to how fast magma can kill you.
  - Stepping on magma causes an almost instant kill, making it as a
    "kill brick" for obstacle course maps.
  - You can make a "Shredder", a fast way of destroying blocks, with
    magma.
  - It is not advisable to dig straight way up or down as it may lead
    you to magma pools and die.
