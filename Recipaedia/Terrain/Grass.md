## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Grass grows on dirt blocks when there is enough sunlight and near grass
blocks are available. When conditions are right, various flowers, tall
grass blades and vegetables will grow on it. Grass is easily destroyed
by covering it with something heavy and takes a long time to regrow.
Grass block is not obtainable except in [Creative
mode](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") . When grass is broken, it drops
[dirt](dirt "wikilink").*

## Notes

  - Grass can be slept on.

<!-- end list -->

  - Tapping it once with a rake will transform grass into a regular
    [dirt](Dirt.md "wikilink") block; tapping it twice will turn it into a
    [soil](soil "wikilink") block. You can use this to farm.
