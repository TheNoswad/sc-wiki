__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Granite is a tough grey stone that fills the majority of underground
world and makes mountains stand tall. Sometimes contains veins of coal,
and, often deeper, iron. When harvested, turns into cobblestone, which
can be smelted back into pure granite.*

## Crafting

When you break granite, you will get
[cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink").

You can smelt [cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink") in a
[furnace](furnace "wikilink") to get granite.

## Notes

  - Granite can be made into [stairs](Stone_Stairs "wikilink") and
    [slabs](Stone_Slab "wikilink").
  - Can be [painted](Painting "wikilink"). 
  - To craft stone tools and bricks, you need to use
    [cobblestone](cobblestone "wikilink") instead.

## History

  - 2.2: Granite can now be mined without a tool, due to wooden tools
    being removed.
  - 1.0: Added.
