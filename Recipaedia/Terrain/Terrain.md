        Dirt is a very common block found near the surface in most environments.
        It can be easily dug even with bare hands, but is best dug with a shovel.
        When exposed to direct sunlight, grass and flowers will spread to it
        from nearby blocks, if present.

      <span>
        Soil is dirt that has been made suitable for cultivation by using a rake. It can be easily damaged by walking or jumping on it. Soil can be fertilized by sprinkling saltpeter on it, plants will grow faster and slowly use up the fertilizer. Soil that is near water will become moist, making plants grow even faster. Rotten food will eventually turn into compost, which can be used in place of fertilized soil to grow plants just as quickly.

# [Limestone](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Limestone)
![Limestone-0.png](/blocks-24/Limestone-0.png)
Limestone is a brittle whitish stone occasionally found near the surface close to water bodies. It can be easily quarried with a pickaxe, and because of its brittleness even with bare hands. It can be used for making pigments and marble.

# [Granite](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Granite)

Limestone is a brittle whitish stone occasionally found near the surface close to water bodies. It can be easily quarried with a pickaxe, and because of its brittleness even with bare hands. It can be used for making pigments and marble.

# [Basalt](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Basalt)
![Basalt-0.png](/blocks-24/Basalt-0.png)
Basalt is a very tough dark stone of volcanic origin. To mine it effectively it's best to use a strong pickaxe. Basalt is tougher than granite, and forms the majority of deep underground world. Occasionally has pools of magma embedded in it, so be careful when tunnelling. Veins of sulphur and iron ore might sometimes be found when you are deep enough. Even more rarely, you will find the elusive diamond shining brightly from between the rocks. Can be painted.

# [Sandstone](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Sandstone)
![Sandstone-0.png](/blocks-24/Sandstone-0.png)
A brittle yellow stone often found under dry, sandy areas. It can be easily quarried with a pickaxe, and because of its brittleness even with bare hands. It may contain saltpeter, which is found in shallow, flat veins in places where in the ancient times birds nested and covered the ground with their nitrogen rich droppings. Can be painted.

# [Gravel](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Gravel)
![Gravel-0.png](/blocks-24/Gravel-0.png)
Gravel is an aggregate of fine stones. Caches of gravel are often found underground, and it sometimes covers beaches. It is then known under the name of shingle. Gravel is a loose material that will collapse when tunnelled under, and may easily bury the unwary, so be careful. It is the best source of rocks for throwing.

# [Clay](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Moist_Soil)
![Clay-0.png](/blocks-24/Clay-0.png)
Clay is a heavy, densely packed soil made of very small grains. From time immemorial it was known that by firing it in a furnace one can obtain bricks, which are the most versatile building material. Clay is often found on the bottoms of shallow lakes. Can be painted.

# [Grass](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Grass)
![Grass-0.png](/blocks-24/Grass-0.png)
Grass grows on dirt blocks when there is enough sunlight available. When conditions are right, various flowers, tall grass blades and vegetables will grow on it. Grass is easily destroyed by covering it with something heavy and takes a long time to regrow.

# [Snow](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Snow)
![Snow-0.png](/blocks-24/Snow-0.png)
A form of frozen water, covers ground in cold biomes. During cold weather, it may fall from the sky as snowfall and cover any area exposed directly to the sky.

# [Ice](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Ice)
![Ice-0.png](/blocks-24/Ice-0.png)
A form of frozen water, covers ground in cold biomes. During cold weather, it may fall from the sky as snowfall and cover any area exposed directly to the sky.

# [Stone](/Recipaedia/Terrain/Stone)
![Rock-0.png](/blocks-24/Rock-0.png)
A stone can be a formidable weapon in the hands of a skilled thrower. They are plentiful and easy to obtain. The best stones are found by digging in gravel blocks.
