## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Limestone is a brittle whitish stone occasionally found near the
surface close to water bodies. It can be easily quarried with a pickaxe,
and because of its brittleness even with bare hands. It can be used for
making pigments and marble.*

## Notes

  - Limestone is the key ingredient in making all
    [paints](Painting "wikilink"). Use it to make [White
    Pigment](White_Pigment "wikilink").
  - It is often used as a decorative block.
  - It spawns typically in streaks or paths.
  - Limestone is very similar to [Sandstone](Sandstone "wikilink").
  - You can smelt Limestone and [Sand](Sand "wikilink") in a
    [furnace](furnace "wikilink") to get [Marble](Marble "wikilink").
