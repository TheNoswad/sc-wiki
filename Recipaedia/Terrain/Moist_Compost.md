## Description (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Soil is dirt that has been made suitable for cultivation by using a
rake. It can be easily damaged by walking or jumping on it. Soil can be
fertilized by sprinkling saltpeter on it, plants will grow faster and
slowly use up the fertilizer. Soil that is near water will become moist,
making plants grow even faster. Rotten food will eventually turn into
compost, which can be used in place of fertilized soil to grow plants
just as quickly*

[Compost](Compost "wikilink") is made as an alternative to
[Soil](Soil "wikilink"), made with rotten food.

## Uses

  - Compost is necessary for [Farming](Farming "wikilink").
  - Can be fertilized with [Saltpeter
    Chunks](Saltpeter_Chunk "wikilink").

## Notes

  - Only drops soil upon breaking, in
    [creative](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") mode. In all of the other
    modes, you acquire [dirt](Dirt.md "wikilink").
