## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*Soil is dirt that has been made suitable for cultivation by using a
rake. It can be easily damaged by walking or jumping on it. Soil can be
fertilized by sprinkling saltpeter on it, plants will grow faster and
slowly use up the fertilizer. Soil that is near water will become moist,
making plants grow even faster. Rotten food will eventually turn into
compost, which can be used in place of fertilized soil to grow plants
just as quickly*

Soil is made when a [dirt](dirt "wikilink") or
[grass](grass "wikilink") block is prepared with a
[rake](Wooden_Rake "wikilink"). If the humidity is high enough, the soil
will turn into [Moist Soil](Moist_Soil.md "wikilink"). The soil is then
ready to grow cultivated crops. See the [Farming
Page](Farming "wikilink") for details. 

## Uses

  - Soil is necessary for [Farming](Farming "wikilink").
  - Can be fertilized with [Saltpeter
    Chunks](Saltpeter_Chunk "wikilink").

## Notes 

  - Only drops soil upon breaking, in
    [creative](Creative_Gamemode "wikilink") mode. In all of the other
    modes, you acquire [dirt](Dirt.md "wikilink").
  - Added in the 1.22 update.\[1\]
