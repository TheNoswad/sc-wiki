## Description   (From [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink") )

*Gravel is an aggregate of fine stones. Caches of gravel are often found
underground, and it sometimes covers beaches. It is then known under the
name of shingle. Gravel is a loose material that will collapse when
tunnelled under, and may easily bury the unwary, so be careful. It's the
best source of rocks for throwing.*

## Uses

Gravel may drop one to three [stone chunks](Stone_Chunk "wikilink")
which can be used as a thrown weapon (with very little damage) or can be
used to craft [stone tip arrows](Stone_Tip_Arrow "wikilink").

## Notes

  - Gravel usually drops one-five [stone chunks](Stone_Chunk "wikilink")
    but may also drop a gravel block.
  - Although it is possible to dig it up using your hands, it is
    recommended that you use a [shovel](Stone_Shovel "wikilink").
  - Gravel and [Sand](Sand "wikilink") fall at a rate of 10 blocks per
    second. Either can easily kill you in an instant if they fall on
    your head. If it doesn't kill you immediately, you will likely
    suffocate.
