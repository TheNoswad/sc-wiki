## Description (from [Recipaedia](.. "wikilink"))

*A stone can be a formidable weapon in the hands of a skilled thrower.
They are plentiful and easy to obtain. The best stones are found by
digging in gravel blocks.*

## Use

Used for the tips of [arrows](Stone_Tip_Arrow "wikilink") or as a thrown
item.

## Notes

Breaking [gravel](gravel "wikilink") blocks will drop 0-3 stone chunks.
But, there is a chance you will get the [Gravel](Gravel.md "wikilink")
block instead of the Stone Chunks. If you need stone chunks, you can
replace the gravel and mine it again until you get stone chunks.

They can be thrown but only do minimal damage.

Stone chunks,or anything else that can be thrown,can be skipped when
thrown on water.
