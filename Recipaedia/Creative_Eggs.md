## Description (From [Recipaedia]( "wikilink"))

*This description applies to all eggs.* Spawner egg. Bird eggs are
occasionally laid by adult birds. If you look carefully, you can find
and eat them. Cooking an egg will increase its nutritional value.
Non-bird spawner eggs are only available in [Creative
mode](Construction/Mechanics/Creative_Gamemode.md "wikilink"). To spawn an animal in creative
mode, throw the egg against a hard surface to smash it. Some exotic
animal spawner eggs are unavailable even in creative mode.

## Exotic animals

Some animals have no spawner egg even in creative mode.

  - [White Tiger](White_Tiger "wikilink") (Found in cold
    [biomes](biomes "wikilink") only)
  - [White Bull](White_Bull "wikilink") (Found in cold biomes only)
  - [Orca](Orca "wikilink") (Found in the ocean only)
  - [Beluga Whale](Beluga_Whale "wikilink") (Found in the ocean only)

Orca Spawner is encoded as 12058742. Beluga Spawner is encoded as
12320886. White Bull Spawner is encoded as 1572982. White Tiger Spawner
is encoded as 6291574. Therefore, you can replace the egg in hand with
this value by [editing the Project
file](../Technical/Hacking_The_Project_File.md "wikilink").

## Bird eggs

These [eggs](eggs "wikilink") are rarely laid by their respective birds.
They can be cooked in a furnace with a water bucket, or eaten raw. They
can also function as spawner eggs even in Survival mode, however not
guaranteeing a spawn every time.

  - [Seagull](../Bestiary/Seagull.md "wikilink") egg
  - [Raven](../Bestiary/Raven.md "wikilink") egg
  - [Duck](Duck "wikilink") egg
  - [Cassowary](Cassowary "wikilink") egg
  - [Ostrich](Ostrich "wikilink") egg

## Notes

  - When hatched in non-creative modes, they have a 1/3 chance of
    spawning.
  - As of the 1.21 update, Spawner Eggs are colored according to what
    animal they represent. 
  - It has been noted that after some updates, ostrich or cassowary eggs
    may turn into different spawner eggs such as gnu eggs, donkey eggs,
    reindeer eggs, moose eggs and blank eggs (if you have a world with
    version 1.28 or earlier containing seagull eggs it will turn into
    eggs that spawn [White Bulls](White_Bull "wikilink")).
  - Like magnets and boats, if you spawn a large amount of creatures a
    message saying "Too Many Creatures" appear. See the page on [animal
    spawning](Animal_Spawning "wikilink").
