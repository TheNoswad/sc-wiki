## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*A large square light emitting diode. When connected to a power source
emits weak colored light. The color of the light depends on the value of
signal aplied to the diode. 0.8V or above produces light of 8 different
colors. The light is too weak to light up the surroundings, but it's
easily visible. Useful for creating color screens. It has inputs on all
sides for easy connection and can be placed on any surface.*

## Use

The 1-LED is wired just like the lightbulb and it will accept an
'analog' signal. If a 'digital' signal is used, the 1-LED will have the
color purple when it's on.

It will display a color based on the applied voltage as follows:

0.8 - White

0.9 - Cyan

1.0 - Red

1.1 - Blue

1.2 - Yellow

1.3 - Green

1.4 - Orange

1.5 - Purple
