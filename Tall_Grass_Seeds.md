## Description   (From [Recipaedia](Recipaedia "wikilink"))

*Seeds are used to plant various types of plants, such as grass, flowers
and rye. Some plants need well tilled, moist and fertilized soil to grow
properly. Otherwise their growth will be stunted and they will not reach
full size.*

## Crafting

Place tall grass in the crafting table or the personal crafting box.

You get 2 seeds.

## Uses

These tall grass seeds are not particularly useful. They can be used to
plant Tall Grass on dirt or soil blocks. This newly planted tall grass
starts out small and will fully mature within 5 minutes. You can then
make those grasses into more seeds.
